Given the importance of credit management and collections, roles are central to many operations, typically setting policies, facilitating sales, managing financial risk and customer&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;relationships. Through this work credit management protects cash flow and facilitates all wider business activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Commercial teams have significant responsibility and manage high value accounts. Roles are typically fast-paced and target driven, requiring detailed knowledge of law, regulations and the business environment, and skilled practitioners possess excellent technical and interpersonal skills. Credit management and collections are rewarding career choices for self-motivated and enthusiastic individuals who would enjoy a varied role working at the centre of operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within this, the focus of the Credit controller and collector role is typically to monitor and manage customer accounts; follow organisational policies to collect monies owed and ensure that work quality targets are met. This requires proactive interaction with customers who have not paid or who have reached credit limits or terms in order to minimise bad debts while retaining positive relationships for the longer term. The range of activities within the role could include, but are not limited to, processing credit applications; agreeing credit terms and/or payment arrangements; invoicing; monitoring payment; allocating and reconciling cash; proactively contacting customers to collect debt, outstanding balances; resolving straight-forward disputes; debt support, and recommending write offs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Typical job titles:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Credit controller credit collector, Debt collection and Agent third party collection&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements - Knowledge, skills and behaviours that the apprentice will demonstrate on completion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 109px;&quot; width=&quot;109&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 355px;&quot; width=&quot;355&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;109&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Credit management&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;355&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Broad understanding of the principles of credit management and collections together with a sound understanding of organisational policies and techniques used in their role, e.g. credit terms; use of external sources of information, e.g. credit scores; and policies for handling vulnerable customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;109&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Regulatory and compliance&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;355&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Broad understanding of the legal, regulatory, risk and compliance framework within which they operate, with a sound understanding of relevant risk and compliance requirements for their role, e.g. credit management policies, data protection, treating customers fairly, potentially fraudulent transactions, including anti-money laundering arrangements and financial and sector regulatory requirements depending on the type of collections.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;109&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Industry and organisation understanding&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;355&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understands professional standards; the nature and priorities of the organisation they work in; organisational ‘values’; and where their role fits in the organisation.

It is recommended that employers may want most candidates to have Level 2 Maths and English. Other relevant or prior experience may also be considered as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The length of this apprenticeship is typically 12 – 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are no required qualifications for this apprenticeship. Apprentices without level 1 English and Maths will need to achieve this level and take the test for level 2 English and maths prior to completion of their apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship is likely to be an entry level role to the organisation. On completion of this apprenticeship, the apprentice will be fully competent in the role and can continue to develop their career within the organisation through a range of possible pathways. These include senior credit controller and collector, credit risk analyst, team leader and credit manager. If the apprentice chooses to study the suggested CICM qualification, they will become affiliate members of the Chartered Institute of Credit Management. This will put them on the pathway towards full qualification as a credit manager and full professional membership of the Chartered Institute of Credit Management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 2 apprenticeship&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 years or when significant change is required.&lt;/p&gt;",
