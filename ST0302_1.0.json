  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;The role of a Personal Trainer is to coach clients (on a one to one and small group basis) towards their health and fitness goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Through the design and provision of creative and personalised exercise programmes and instruction, nutritional advice and overall lifestyle management, Personal Trainers will motivate clients to positively change their behaviour and improve their overall wellbeing by providing specialist, tailored advice within their scope of practice, while always being aware of when to refer clients to relevant appropriate professionals for specialist information and guidance (e.g. physiotherapist, registered dietician, medical specialist).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive understanding of business, finance, sales and marketing is also essential to enable the Personal Trainer to build and retain a stable client base.
