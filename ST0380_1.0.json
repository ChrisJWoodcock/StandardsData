Nuclear Technicians provide all the required technical support to enable the engineers and technologists to function effectively, while adhering to correct procedures and health and safety guidelines. Nuclear Technicians solve technical problems. Under supervision they will scope and manage technical work tasks in support of a variety of engineering/science based projects. Tasks can vary depending on the specific discipline but typically involve:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Preparation of technical reports and information to assist managers in decision making&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Utilise problem solving techniques to identify technical improvements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sampling, testing, measuring, recording and interpretation of results to present to senior colleagues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carrying out routine tasks accurately and following strict methodologies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Setting up, maintaining and operating equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using computers and performing mathematical calculations for the preparation of data&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keeping up to date with technical developments, especially those which can save time and improve reliability and performance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will have a fundamental and core knowledge of engineering / science principles and practices and will be able to demonstrate discipline skills, project management skills commensurate with their employed job role that typically may include design, plant performance enhancements, operational control, quality control, project engineering and maintenance of environmental health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;y Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers will set their own entry requirements. Typically, candidates will have achieved grade C or above in at least five GCSEâ€™s including English, Maths and a Science subject, and hold a minimum of 240 UCAS points. Other relevant or prior experience may also be considered as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ccupational Knowledge: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Nuclear Technician must be able to know and understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The concepts, principles and theories of engineering science relevant to the interdisciplinary fields of nuclear technology.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant stakeholders, commercial and business acumen, business improvement process, project and business management techniques relevant to the nuclear industry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Science or engineering discipline knowledge to support the development of operation, maintenance and progression of technologies for example in Decommissioning (e.g. remote handling and robotics), Waste Management, Reprocessing, and Nuclear Power Generation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to engage with and support the successful outcome of nuclear projects.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to analyse and apply the results of research and information gathering to evaluate and to propose solutions to a particular nuclear technology application.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The regulatory requirements for both national and international and its relevance to the job role.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The nuclear industry (past, present and future) and the business, political and community environment in which the company operates including personal role within the organisation, ethical practice and codes of conduct.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to implement methods of determining the root cause of problems and demonstrating knowledge of learning from experience (LFE) processes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The technology, safety, environmental and economics for a variety of nuclear scenarios for example the nuclear fuels, the nuclear fuel cycle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How the standards for nuclear professional practice as required by the industry and professional body institutions are applied.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ccupational Skills:
