  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services industry encompasses a broad range of businesses that manage, or consult around managing money. These include retail and corporate banking, investment management, investment consulting, investment banking, mortgages, and life and pensions. The completion of this apprenticeship will enable individuals to become highly competent professionals for the industry. This will be delivered by a base of core knowledge, skills and behaviours required of all individuals entering or progressing to this level in the sector, and a set of specialist options that then provide the occupationally specific competence, depending on the part of the sector and type of business the individual works for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;353&quot;&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Profiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;strong&gt;Core and Options&lt;/strong&gt; model, where the shared knowledge, skills and behaviours are covered in the core, with the specific technical knowledge and skills required for each role being covered in the single chosen option. Below is an overview of the role and typical job titles covered by each option:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;353&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Retail Banking &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These roles are within retail banking, covering both branch and head office roles. Retail banking, also known as Consumer Banking, is the provision of services to individual consumers, rather than to companies, corporations or other banks. Services offered include savings and transactional accounts, mortgages, personal loans, debit cards, and credit cards. The roles are typically responsible for delivering effective retail branch services or head office functions that support these branch services, where they are likely to be leading teams/business areas in order to meet customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Typical Job Titles:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Retail Banking Manager, Retail Branch Manager, Head Office management, Individual Banking Manager, Relationship Manager (Retail)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;353&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Commercial/Business Banking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These roles sit within the commercial/business banking part of the sector. Typically at this level they provide relationship management to small and medium size business clients/customers, assessing their financial performance and proactively matching banking products and services to their needs. They may also provide specialist advice on a range of more technical banking products such as equipment, invoice and trade finance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Typical Job Titles:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#160; Commercial Relationship Manager, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Account Manager, Commercial Product Specialist, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate/Business Banking Support Manager, Relationship Manager (Corporate)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;353&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Investment Banking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Investment Banking is the creation of capital for corporate, government and financial institution clients/customers, through the provision of capital markets and financing solutions. Additionally Investment Banking involves the provision of investment advice, trading and post-trade services to professional investors across a range of financial instruments. Typically at this level the role involves providing technical/specialist support to those in direct trading and senior client/customer advisory roles, in addition to providing some day-to-day trade support to clients/customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Typical Job Titles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&#160; Junior Advisor, Analyst, Junior Sales Trader, Junior Trader, Research Analyst, Junior Client Marketer, Junior/Assistant Risk Manager. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;353&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Investment Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Investment management (also known as asset or fund management) and Investment consulting are about either managing, or providing advice around the management of a client&#39;s/customer’s money, to meet investment goals, such as capital growth and/or income generation. Clients/customers may be individuals or institutions. Typically the roles focus on the analyst and fund/portfolio support roles, usually involving: financial statement analysis, asset selection, stock selection, implementation and monitoring of investments and providing investment recommendations to clients/customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Typical Job Titles:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Research Analyst, Financial Analyst, Investment Analyst, Credit Analyst, Junior Dealer, Assistant Portfolio Manager, Trainee Investment Manager, Trainee Investment Advisor, Investment Consulting Analyst, Client facing Analyst.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;353&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are junior management level roles working within the operational and administrative areas of businesses in the sector. These roles are in most areas of financial services, where transactional and process management is needed, and require a significant level of technical and sector skill and knowledge in order to deliver successfully. The role may sit within a number of different specialist business functions such as customer service, global payments, investment operation transactions, product control, and change management. Typically at this level the role will be starting to lead teams and managing service delivery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Typical Job Titles:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#160; Operations Manager, Operations Team Lead, Product Controller Lead, Business Performance Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;353&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Workplace Pensions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The roles in this part of the sector are positioned within specialist workplace pensions businesses, or, in-house teams who are responsible for managing the workplace pension scheme of the organisation. The roles provide support to clients/customers on an administrative or consultancy basis within the very complex world of workplace pensions.&#160; At this level, the role may contain both the admin and consultancy elements. In particular, the roles require a sound understanding of both the general principles and structures of workplace pension schemes, together with the specifics for their clients/customers, as much variation is possible between clients/customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Typical Job Titles: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pensions Consultant, Pensions Manager, Senior Pensions Administrator, Administration Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Knowledge – required by all apprentices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;19%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;19%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Industry and organisation understanding&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Deep understanding of the structure of the Financial Services industry and in particular the role their part of the sector and organisation plays; the purpose of the function in which they work; how their function relates to the wider business.&#160; Good understanding of the impact the external environment has on Financial Services as appropriate to their role, together with relevant best practice.
