  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Prosthetist/Orthotist is a registered clinician. This unique occupation provides the opportunity to practice in two areas of healthcare. Most will specialise in Prosthetics or Orthotics; a small number continue in both. &lt;strong&gt;Prosthetists&lt;/strong&gt; Provide gait (walking) analysis &amp;amp; engineering solutions to patients with limb(s) loss. They are trained in mechanics, bio-mechanics, &amp;amp; material science along with anatomy, physiology &amp;amp; pathophysiology. They are able to design, provide &amp;amp; modify prostheses that replicate the structural or functional characteristics of a patient’s absent limb(s). They provide care to patients with congenital (from birth) loss as well as loss due to conditions including diabetes, reduced vascularity, infection &amp;amp; trauma. &lt;strong&gt;Orthotists&lt;/strong&gt; Provide gait (walking) analysis &amp;amp; engineering solutions to patients with problems of the neuro, muscular &amp;amp; skeletal systems. They apply mechanics, bio-mechanics, &amp;amp; material science along with anatomy, physiology &amp;amp; pathophysiology when assessing patients. They design &amp;amp; provide orthoses that modify the structural or functional characteristics of a patient’s neuro, muscular &amp;amp; skeletal systems enabling them to mobilise, eliminate gait deviations (improve walking), reduce falls, reduce pain, prevent &amp;amp; facilitate healing of ulcers &amp;amp; prevent physical deformities from progressing. They fit &amp;amp; modify Orthoses, an accountable and responsible for the impact of any changes. They provide care to patients with a wide range of conditions. Prosthetists / Orthotists manage their own patient caseloads, work across all age ranges &amp;amp; with a wide variety of conditions, often providing lifetime care. Whilst autonomous practitioner with leadership &amp;amp; management responsibilities they work as key part of a Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) to provide holistic care to patients &amp;amp; work collaboratively with members of the MDT through the provision of rehabilitation &amp;amp; long-term care. Prosthetists &amp;amp; Orthotists work for both the NHS &amp;amp; independent companies. Prosthetists/Orthotists demonstrate confidence, compassion, competency &amp;amp; effective judgement about risk &amp;amp; be responsible &amp;amp; accountable for their decisions. &#160;Prosthetist &amp;amp; Orthotists instruct and guide their technicians in the specification and manufacture of prostheses and orthoses. They also advise them in matters of patient interaction and care when the technicians are dealing directly with patients for example for repairs. They use current evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of their practice with the aim of continually improving outcomes for patients. They are responsible for ensuring their own knowledge &amp;amp; skills are current &amp;amp; support the development of others.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day to Day Activities include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Provide &lt;strong&gt;prosthetic/ Orthotic&lt;/strong&gt; care to patients, most commonly within a hospital environment, working closely with medical staff, physio and occupational therapists&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Assess &amp;amp; prescribe tailored orthoses &amp;amp;/or prostheses treatment; working in partnership with patients to tailor treatments to their needs &amp;amp; develop a treatment plan (which may be part of a wider MDT package of care)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Analyse patient’s needs &amp;amp; involve them in the design &amp;amp; choice of their devise, take measurements (including moulds) &amp;amp;/or use computer modelling to produce a design of the prostheses or orthoses suited to the patient&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Provide and fit the orthoses &amp;amp; prostheses; educate the patient on how to manage and adjust their device to improve function further&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Support patients to maximise their potential over the time of treatment – which could be life long&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out clinical follow-up checks with a patient to see how they are managing with their device &amp;amp; being able to spot ill-fitting/sub-optimal functioning &amp;amp; take appropriate action&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Use research, evidence &amp;amp; clinical experience to develop professionally &amp;amp; improve outcomes for patients &amp;amp; the profession (Including participation in clinical audit)&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Employers will set selection criteria. This might include GCSEs, A levels, other relevant qualifications, relevant experience &amp;amp;/or an aptitude test.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices will be required to complete a Health &amp;amp; Care Professions Council (HCPC) approved BSc (Hons) programme in Prosthetics &amp;amp; Orthotics&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English &amp;amp; maths will need to achieve this level prior to completing the end-point assessment. For those with an education, health &amp;amp; care plan or a legacy statement the apprenticeships English &amp;amp; maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3 &amp;amp; British Sign Language qualification are an alternative to English qualifications for whom this is their primary language.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional registration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On successful completion, apprentices are eligible to apply to the HCPC for registration as Prosthetist/Orthotist, which is a requirement to practice under the protected title.
