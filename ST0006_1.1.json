In addition, Lead Adult Care Workers have responsibility for providing supervision, frontline leadership, guidance and direction for others, or working autonomously, exercising judgement and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Typical job titles include Care Officer, Care Supervisor, Senior Care Worker, Supervising Care Worker, Senior Support Worker, Relief Team Leader, Social Work Assistant, Social Services Officer, Outreach Development Worker, Community Support Worker, Community Outreach Worker, Community Development Worker, Family Support Worker or Personal Assistant. These could all specialise in a variety of areas such as learning disability, mental health, drug and alcohol misuse, homecare, dementia and end-of-life care.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As a Lead Adult Care Worker you will make a positive difference to someone’s life when they are faced with physical, practical, social, emotional or intellectual challenges. You will be expected to exercise judgement and take appropriate action to support individuals to maintain their independence, dignity and control. By providing leadership, guidance and direction at the frontline of care delivery you will be instrumental in improving the health and wellbeing of those receiving care and support. Lead Adult Care Workers will in some circumstances have delegated responsibility for the standard of care provided and may supervise the work of other care workers. This exercising of autonomy and accountability means leading and supporting others to comply with expected standards and behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lead Adult Care Workers may work in residential or nursing homes, domiciliary care, day centres or some clinical healthcare settings. As well as covering Lead Adult Care Workers this standard also covers Lead Personal Assistants who can work at this senior level but they may only work directly for one individual who needs support and/or care services, usually within their own home.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;These are the personal attributes and behaviours expected of all Lead Adult Care Workers carrying out their roles:&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Care – is caring consistently and enough about individuals to make a positive difference to their lives&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Compassion – is delivering care and support with kindness, consideration, dignity, empathy and respect&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Courage – is doing the right thing for people and speaking up if the individual they support is at risk&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Communication – good communication is central to successful caring relationships and effective team working&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Competence – is applying knowledge and skills to provide high quality care and support&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Commitment – to improving the experience of people who need care and support ensuring it is person centred&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 18 months&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;3&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;A Lead Adult Care Worker must know and understand:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;A.
