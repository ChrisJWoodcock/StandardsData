  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A career in nursing is dynamic and exciting with opportunities to work in a range of different roles as a Registered Nurse. Your nursing career will mean working with a variety of service users, families and carers, and with a range of health and care professionals and other agencies. You might be working in: a hospital, someone’s home, the community, social care or public health. Registered nurses are a key part of the multidisciplinary teams that meet the health and care needs of patients and service users. You will be at the centre of teams that can include other health and social care professionals. The current Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) standards comprise a common core of skills and knowledge for all nursing students, with specialisms in adult nursing, children’s nursing, mental health and learning disabilities. The apprentice must meet the 15 standards required by the Care Quality Commission [as set out in the Care Certificate].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities and duty of the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will use your expertise to assess, plan, implement and evaluate &#160;care, putting the needs of patients and service users first. You will be responsible and accountable for your work and for reviewing the effectiveness of your actions. &#160;You will be expected to demonstrate leadership qualities whatever your role and you may manage and lead colleagues. You will be responsible for ensuring your own knowledge and skills are up to date, and support the development of learners and new entrants to the profession. You must uphold the NMC Code and meet the NMC requirements for continuing registration.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ntry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The NMC approves institutions that can provide nurse education and sets standards for programmes that lead to registration as a nurse in the UK. NMC standards also incorporate the requirements of the EU directive that governs the free movement of nurses within the European Economic Area.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Degree in Nursing. Prior to commencement apprentices will have their numeracy and literacy skills assessed by the NMC Approved Education Institution to ensure the apprentice has the necessary skills at a minimum of Level 2 to meet the requirements of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Registration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On completion of the apprenticeship you will meet the qualification requirements to apply for registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Level&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Duration&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 48 months&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Review date&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 years&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Apprentices&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Complete the core and one option&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will be caring and compassionate, honest, conscientious and committed&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will treat people with dignity, respecting individual&#39;s diversity, beliefs, culture, needs, values, privacy and preferences. You will show respect and empathy for those you work with, have the courage to challenge areas of concern and work to evidence based best practice. You will also be adaptable, reliable and consistent, show discretion, resilience and self-awareness and demonstrate leadership&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nmc.org.uk/standards/additional-standards/standards-for-competence-for-registered-nurses/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ndards for Competence for Registered Nurses (2015)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;are published by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The skills and knowledge listed below are taken from that document.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Essential skills clusters support the achievement of the standards for competence.
