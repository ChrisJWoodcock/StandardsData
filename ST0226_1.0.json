Many businesses will be specialised in their activities, such as grounds maintenance (soft-landscape) or landscape construction (hard-landscape). Soft-landscaping includes the establishment and maintenance of plants and cultivated areas. Hard-landscaping includes establishment of hard surfaces and structures in addition to the establishment of plants in cultivated areas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The distinct nature of these two specialisms means very few businesses can offer the full breadth of skills and therefore two options are available for this occupation; horticulture and landscape construction. The employment area will dictate the option pursued. The horticulture option focuses on plant propagation and plant growth. The landscape construction option focuses on the installation of features and structures; application of landscape materials as well as site management.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Landscape or horticulture supervisor can manage a site with minimum supervision, supervise a team and maintain the health and safety and security of personnel and resources.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Working and learning in the horticulture and landscape industries is rewarding, offers a diverse range of employment opportunities and includes a range of skills that are transferable into other industries following further studies.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Required skills, knowledge and behaviours to complete this apprenticeship&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Core knowledge - have an understanding of;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Industry understanding; the importance and benefits of green-space and different types of horticultural management appropriate to different sites.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Business; project processes, planning work scheduling and requirements to meet specification, working to a budget.

In order that apprentices are not disadvantaged who hold these qualifications, the employers have agreed that they can enter end-point assessment (providing all other requirements have been met) up until Tuesday 30th June 2020. As from Wednesday 1st July 2020, all apprentices entering EPA, must have completed an Ofqual regulated, Level 3 Emergency First Aid at Work (EFAW) one day course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Apprenticeship level&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship standard is at level 3.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Review date&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3 years from implementation.&lt;/p&gt;",
