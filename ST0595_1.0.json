It covers the core requirements shared by all employers across the Civil and Military Air Traffic Controller sectors.&#160; Employers may have additional training requirements, depending on the geographical air space they manage, the traffic complexity, and any additional rating endorsements or licencing requirements that sit outside of the Apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The UK manages one of the busiest and most complex pieces of airspace in the world. A range of specialist air traffic controller roles contribute to the safe and efficient movement of aircraft with civil and military operations working collaboratively to maintain a fully integrated service to all users, 24 hours a day, every day of the year&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Air Traffic Controllers work in a number of aviation environments such as an air traffic control centres, commercial airports, military bases and aerodromes, or other airfields; some air traffic controllers find their training and experience useful in consultancy, aerospace manufacturing or in the global aerospace industry. The guiding principle of air traffic control is to deliver a safe, efficient and reliable service using their knowledge and skills.&#160; Air traffic controllers in the UK would usually work for a commercial/ civil employer or the military.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Tasks will vary depending on the specialism of the air traffic controller but include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;preventing collisions between aircraft and between aircraft and obstacles&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;making sure that minimum safe distances are maintained between aircraft&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;keeping radio contact with aircraft&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;maintaining surveillance contact with aircraft using equipment such as RADAR&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;issuing instructions to aircraft&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;expediting and maintaining a safe and orderly flow of air traffic&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;providing information to aircraft about information pertinent to the flight&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;monitoring data systems&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;handling unexpected events, emergencies, and unscheduled traffic.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship adopts a core and options approach to allow flexibility for employers and enable transferability between roles and employers for apprentices. All apprentices must attain competence in each of the core knowledge, skills and behaviours. In addition, one specialist option (for additional knowledge and skills) must be taken out of the eight specialisms listed further below, which are Civil Area/ Terminal Controller, Civil Approach Controller, Civil Approach Procedural Controller, Civil Aerodrome Controller, Military Weapons Controller,&#160; Military Area Radar Controller, Military Terminal Radar Controller, Military Terminal Aerodrome Controller.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Typical job titles include:&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Civil Area/ Terminal Controller, Civil Approach Controller, Civil Approach Procedure Controller, Civil Aerodrome Controller, Military Weapons Controller, Military Area Radar Controller, Military Terminal Radar Controller, Military Terminal Aerodrome Controller.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Skills, Knowledge and Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The subjects, topics and sub topics together with the training and performance objectives are laid down in a European regulation and UK Competent Authority publications.&#160;
