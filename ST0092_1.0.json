Community energy projects are often delivered collectively, with a focus on engagement, local leadership and strong positive local community outcomes. There are now around 5000 of these community groups UK-wide which often have distinct, specific localised goals with an overarching benefit of tackling climate change, energy security and the affordability of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Community Energy Specialist works in a range of different organisations including community energy enterprises, local authorities, housing associations, grid network operators, and commercial energy companies, with all Community Energy Specialists employing the following disciplines within a community energy organisation
