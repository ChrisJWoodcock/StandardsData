  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ecology is a wide discipline extending &#160;to all the relationships between plants, animals, people, and their environment, and the&#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/balance&quot;&gt;balances&lt;/a&gt; between these relationships. In practice, some aspects receive more attention than others due to perceptions, usually associated with rarity, cultural significance, or commercial value.&#160; Ecologists have an important role to play in resolving potentially conflicting demands between economic development and the environment to create a ‘win-win’ scenario.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A fully competent ecologist will be able to work in a wide range of organisations including, but not exclusively, ecological consultancy, local authorities and Non-Governmental Organisations, government agencies and in the private sector and are likely to work in the filed/on site as well as in an office environment.&#160; The role covers a range of technical and scientific activities, which may include significant field-based investigations and/or analysis and interpretation of data generated by fieldwork. &#160;They will analyse, interpret and evaluate relevant scientific information, concepts and &lt;br /&gt;ideas and use these to develop surveys/investigations, implement these, write reports and propose solutions to problems&lt;em&gt;. &#160;&lt;/em&gt;They will be able to apply knowledge of underlying scientific principles to implement new processes based on existing knowledge and, or input from senior team members, and provide advice for example, during the planning of developments from small residential to major infrastructure scale.&#160; They will be able to provide and implement solutions meeting the needs of the growth agenda while minimising adverse impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ecologists, whether working as consultants, scientists or in the policy arena will be able to work both autonomously and as part of a wider team, taking responsibility for the quality of the work that is undertaken, to deliver scientific value to their organisation. Ecologists typically undertake a significant proportion of fieldwork as part of their job as well as being in the office and, or laboratory. They will be proactive in identifying problems, areas of business improvement and propose innovative ideas and solutions. In all contexts working safely and ethically is paramount and many companies operate under highly regulated conditions related to health and safety and stakeholder confidentiality. &#160;Project management and communication skills are integral to this role.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The typical specialisms in which an Ecologist will operate are as an:-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Ecological Consultant;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Ecological Scientist or&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Landscape Ecologist&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An individual will need to choose 1 of these options (in liaison with their employer).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Requirements: &#160;to have the knowledge and understanding of: &#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the underlying scientific principles in ecology and how to carry out field-based investigations in accordance with ‘best practice’ within the industry and/or input from colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the principles underlying ecological field work techniques, such as Preliminary Ecological Appraisal, Phase 1 Habitat survey, ‘best practice’ in species survey/monitoring, and of the role of evaluation to inform future projects.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the theoretical knowledge of the advanced science and technology required to progress in the job role and relevant area of specialisation and the importance of emerging evidence.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;project management procedures and the importance of these in the working environment, both in the office and in the field, in collaboration with multidisciplinary team members.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the internal/in-house policies, for example those relating to safe practice, lone working, professional conduct, as well record keeping, traceability and confidentiality&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the external regulations/legislation, those pertinent to the sector and organisation, such as those relating to specific species, protected areas and habitats and the importance of minimising disturbance during site-based investigations as well as that relating to Health and Safety&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the business environment in which the company operates including personal role within the organisation, ethical practice and codes of conduct.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the requirements of internal/external customers and the appropriate workflows, improvements and/or scientific solutions for specific projects.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Requirements: skills and competency in the following areas:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Good verbal and written communication skills, ability to plan and execute well-structured fieldwork, produce clear and concise technical reports, with appropriate interpretation and presentation of data;
