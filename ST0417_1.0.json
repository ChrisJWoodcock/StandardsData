  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Civil Engineers provide technical and management input to develop design solutions for complex civil engineering problems. They will work as part of a team of engineers and other construction professionals through all lifecycle stages of development, design, construction, commissioning, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of civil engineering infrastructure. &#160;A Civil Engineer will be required to have a broad skills base to work in areas including sustainable construction, structural integrity, geotechnics (engineering behaviour of earth materials), materials, tunnelling, marine and coastal engineering, water, waste management, flood management, transportation and power. &#160;A Civil Engineer might work in public and private sector organisations including local authorities, central government departments and agencies, engineering consultancy practices, contracting firms and research and development organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;A Civil Engineer’s work comprises:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project delivery&lt;/strong&gt; – An awareness of business, client and end user needs throughout the project lifecycle. Plan and manage tasks, people and commercial budgets to deliver quality assured outputs on time and to client and industry specifications, standards and guidance.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt; – Define engineering and other constraints, identify risks and how these may be resolved through design. Develop safe and sustainable technical solutions and provide guidance to others by producing design models, calculations, reports and drawings, surveying a site, using applicable analysis and relevant codes.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; – Identify and use applicable digital solutions, other data gathering tools and tests to solve technical problems. Evaluate the effectiveness of the analysis, refine as required, and apply to an integrated solution.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construction&lt;/strong&gt; – Determine construction methods and technical aspects of site activities. Identify and mitigate risk, develop and operate quality systems and health, safety and risk management procedures.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeship candidates will typically have at least three A levels at Grades A*-C including Mathematics and Physical Science or their equivalent or will have completed a Level 3 Apprenticeship as a Civil Engineering Technician.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Duration&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The typical duration for this apprenticeship is 60-66 months but this will depend on the previous experience of the apprentice and access to opportunities to gain the full range of competence.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Level&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 6 Apprenticeship.&#160; On completion the apprentice will have fully satisfied the requirements for registration as an Incorporated Engineer by the relevant professional engineering institution.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Successful apprentices will gain a BSc or BEng civil engineering degree which is accredited by the Joint Board of Moderators.&#160; (The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ice.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Institution of Civil Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.istructe.org/Pages/SeDefault.aspx&quot;&gt;Institution of Structural Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iht.org/&quot;&gt;Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ihie.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Institute of Highway Engineers&lt;/a&gt; form the Joint Board of Moderators which assesses and makes recommendations on the accreditation and approval of relevant educational programmes that it will accept as meeting the requirement to register as a professional engineer with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engc.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Engineering Council.)&#160; &#160;&lt;/a&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and Maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Apprenticeship Standard will be reviewed after 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Civil Engineer will require a comprehensive and in-depth knowledge of:-&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The principles and techniques used to evaluate the impact of civil engineering infrastructure on society and the environment taking account of business, client and end user needs in its construction, management and use.
