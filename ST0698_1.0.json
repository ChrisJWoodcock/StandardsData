At this level, they will typically be working for a more senior transport planning professional and may have some line management responsibilities of technicians. Transport Planners often work with other professionals across their organisation, including those involved in planning, environmental assessment, engineering and construction, but they also liaise with a wide range of stakeholders including the general public and regulatory bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for leading smaller projects, and/or playing a key role in a larger programme, managing their own work with a high level of autonomy, reviewing technical input from others, responding positively to complex and unpredictable situations, and be able to influence and make decisions that support others in or external to their own organisation.&#160; They will operate effectively within organisational, financial and resource constraints, comply with policy and regulatory requirements, whilst maintaining high levels of professional conduct, ethical behaviour and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical job titles include:&#160; &lt;/strong&gt;Transport Planner, Senior Transport Planner, Transport Planning and Strategic Advisor, Transport Policy Advisor, Transport Planning Consultant, Transport Economist, Transport Modeller.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DUTIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 20%;&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Topic&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this occupation a fully competent employee can:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For this duty, list the important performance considerations for employers in terms of how the work is to be done and to what standards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 15%;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days required to complete off the job (OTJ) training for this duty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1.
