Rail Infrastructure Operators will be required to work closely with stakeholders e.g. controllers, train drivers, maintenance staff, power companies and specialists e.g. emergency services in order to respond effectively to incidents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rail Infrastructure Operators may be required to work in a small control location, a major operations control room or be required to go trackside depending on their discipline and the activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship adopts a core and options approach to allow flexibility for employers and enable transferability between roles and employers for apprentices. The core content includes safety, quality and customer service, the apprentice will then follow one of the following specialist options: Signalling Operator, Electrical Controller or Incident Responder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signalling Operators &lt;/strong&gt;are responsible for the movement of rail transport through the safe operation of signalling control systems. Signalling Operators regulate the safe movement and control of rail transport and communicate to rail transport drivers, those working on rail infrastructure as well as members of the public, to enable them to move or work safely across the network.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrical Controllers &lt;/strong&gt;are responsible for maintaining and controlling the electrical supply to the rail network to ensure the smooth operation of passenger services, safe access to the rail network for maintenance and incident response. Electrical supply is required for signalling, traction and other assets, such as tunnel ventilation systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident Responders &lt;/strong&gt;are responsible for making the rail infrastructure safe and minimising service disruptions following an incident or event, this can range from low-level situations (e.g. level crossing failure and animals on the line) through to supporting major events (e.g. derailment, fatalities and fire).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on the nature and scale, an Incident Responder will either take direct action or assist in activities with specialists in order to return back to safe operations and minimise service disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During non-response time Incident Responders will assist colleagues with monitoring the network to identify potential issues and/or incident avoidance activities e.g. weather preparedness, checking of fences and gates or inspecting operational locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENTRY AND QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the entry criteria for their own apprentices. Prior to taking the end point assessment all apprentices must have achieved at least a level 1 qualification in both English and Maths and have also taken the test for level 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSIONAL BODY RECOGNITION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Successful completion of the apprenticeship programme provides eligibility for Associate level of membership with the Institution of Railway Operators or Affiliate level of membership with the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORE BEHAVIOURS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rail Infrastructure Operators need to demonstrate the following behaviours:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t professionally, &lt;/strong&gt;demonstrating dependability, determination, honesty and integrity.

others to identify, respond to and manage incidents on the rail network, either on site or from a control room. E.g. Incident Responders will seek input and advice from both electrical controllers and signalling operators and take the necessary decisions to ensure safe access to the incident site.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be able to take control of an incident, identify the correct type of response and implement a prioritised plan e.g. applying and removing a temporary and emergency speed restriction, removal of objects from overhead line. This may be either as an initial responder to a major event or taking control of a local railway specific event such as animals on the line, level crossing failures and trespassers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure the correct protection measures have been taken to make an incident safe for those directly impacted e.g. colleagues, passengers, emergency services.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Facilitate investigation and recovery activities such as preserving evidence; initiating an investigation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Follow a defined set of procedures which outline the basic response to an incident, such as arrive on site, assess, make safe, report and liaise with others as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",
