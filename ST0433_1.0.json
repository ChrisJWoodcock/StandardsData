  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupational profile:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This Apprenticeship Standard covers two roles: &lt;strong&gt;Engineering construction erector &lt;/strong&gt;and&#160;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering construction rigger&lt;/strong&gt;. Both are vital Engineering Construction roles, working within strictly defined processes and procedures to exacting standards. This often involves working on major infrastructure projects in various sectors such as the power generation sector, which may use a range of different fuels including coal, gas, nuclear, wind and other renewable fuel sources; oil and gas refining; nuclear waste reprocessing; the processing and production of chemicals; pharmaceuticals; human and animal food; cosmetics; petrochemicals; sewerage, steel mill, the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas and the erection and dismantling and decommissioning of steel structures and engineering construction plant of varying sizes and complexity. Riggers and Erectors often work in hazardous environments which can include working at height, over water and in confined spaces.&#160; Riggers and Erectors must be able to work autonomously and as part of a team ensuring compliance with health, safety and environmental processes and procedures, this can involve working with other Engineering Construction occupations such as Maintenance Technicians, Platers, Pipefitters and Welders.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Engineering construction erector &lt;/strong&gt;role encompasses the installation and dismantling of the capital plant steel infrastructure which makes up engineering and construction projects, these operations are by nature complex and non-repetitive. The construction is achieved through the use of static and mobile moving and lifting equipment and accessories and as the assembly of the structure progresses, can involve the use of additional specialist access equipment. Erectors will use powered as well as non-powered hand tools to assemble the structure, this can also require the fixing of metal decking, safety netting and edge rails to facilitate safe working.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Engineering construction rigger &lt;/strong&gt;role encompasses the lifting, moving and positioning of loads during engineering construction projects. It involves, but is not limited to the detailed planning and control of all the elements required to successfully and safely execute and complete the lifting, moving and positioning operation. Riggers are responsible for safely moving loads using static and mobile moving and lifting equipment and accessories. The moving and lifting equipment is diverse and can include specialist equipment such as skids and rollers as well as numerous types of winches, hoists and cranes of various sizes and design.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Job titles:&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Engineering construction rigger and Engineering construction erector&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Suggested entry requirements:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set their own criteria; typically 3 GCSEs (or equivalent) at grade C or above, including English, maths and a science or technology based subject. Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The apprentice must demonstrate the core requirements below and also demonstrate the specialist requirements in their chosen role.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core knowledge requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;All Engineering construction erector rigger
