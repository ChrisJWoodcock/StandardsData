Develop and apply theoretical knowledge of engineering and its application to the required sector &amp;amp; job ro This should be acquired through a qualification set at level 3 (or above) that is approved by a licensed professional engineering institution.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eha&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ou&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;19.The apprentice must also demonstrate the required attitudes, behaviours and interpersonal skills associated with the professional workplace including:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;communicate effectively using a full range of skills: speaking; listening; writing; body language; presentation&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;work and interact effectively within a team and other groups as required&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;work independently and proactively take responsibility for initiating and completing tasks&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;understand impact of work on others, especially where related to diversity and equality&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;excellent time management and ability to complete work to schedule&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;ability to handle change and respond to change management processes in a positive manner&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;pursuing excellence in line with organisational norms and values&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;demonstrate a can do attitude and willingness to operate flexibly to meet business demands.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their apprentices. Most candidates will have achieved grade C or above in English and Maths and a STEM-related subject at Level 2 prior to commencement of apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English &amp;amp; Mathematics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The apprentice will have a depth and breadth of english and mathematics that allow them to operate successfully within their role. This may be met through entry criteria determined by the employer or qualifications and training within the apprenticeship. However, on completion all apprentices will have minimum level 2 qualifications in english and mathematics. Some employers may mandate training or qualifications at level 3 in english and/or mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This standard aligns to the core engineering skills required for similar occupations in other industries. This Standard has been designed to deliver sufficient Underpinning Knowledge and Understanding (UKU) and allow apprentices sufficient experiential, work based learning opportunities to satisfy the requirements for Professional Registration as Engineering Technician (EngTech) as defined by the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning &amp;amp;Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Employers will compile an Apprenticeship training plan that describes the training their apprentice will need to meet the standard. It may include a mixture of external and internal training that will ensure the apprentice is fully competent by the end of their programme and ready to take the assessment. It will show when each area of the standard must be acquired and assessed and which areas may be acquired off the job. An apprentice will receive a minimum of 20% of their training away from their day-to-day job. The apprentice will gain transferable core skills and knowledge. In addition they will gain skills specific to the job role and the working practices of their place of employment. The requirements of the apprenticeship are designed to offer stretch and progression.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This Apprenticeship standard will be reviewed by employers in September 2017.&lt;/p&gt;",
