  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clinical Dental Technicians (CDT) are General Dental Council (GDC) registered dental professionals who provide a complete dentures direct to patients and other dental devices such as partial dentures to the prescription of a dentist. &#160;&#160;The CDT role fits between that of a dental technician and a dentist.&#160; Like a dental technician, they are able to make dentures in a laboratory but, unlike a dental technician, they have direct contact with patients.&#160; Like a dentist, they are able to work in the mouth, taking impressions for the edentulous(1), dentate or patient with implants.&#160; However, they are not able to prescribe to patients who have teeth and therefore work to prescriptions from the dentist as required. The CDT examines, assesses, provides treatment, gives advice and designs, manufactures, modifies and repairs custom-made dental appliances. Working as part of the dental team, they refer endentulous patients to a dentist if they need a treatment plan or if there are oral health concerns.&#160;&#160; Patients with natural teeth or implants must see a dentist before the CDT begins treatment.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Day to day activities include:&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;assessing patients or contributing to patient assessment including taking detailed dental and relevant medical history&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;treating acute oral conditions including prescribing and providing complete dentures directly to patients&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;responding to treatment plans and working closely with patient to identify the best solution for them&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;providing and fitting complete or partial dentures or other dental devices on prescription from a dentist&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;taking impressions, designing and/or manufacturing of a range of dental devices&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;fitting, modifying and repairing a range of dental devices&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;taking and processing radiographs or other images&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;advising and encouraging oral hygiene and care of dental devices&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their apprentices.&#160; You must be a GDC registered dental technician to do this apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;GDC approved level 5 qualification. Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional registration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Clinical Dental Technicians are statutorily regulated health professionals.&#160; They recognise and act within the General Dental Council (GDC) standards, ethical guidance, information governance and relevant laws.&#160; On successful completion of an acceptable qualification the apprentice can apply to register with the GDC as a Clinical Dental Technician.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 24 months&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Date: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 years&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;258&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#160;Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;449&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;258&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will be trustworthy, caring, honest, responsible and committed&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;449&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will treat people with dignity and respect. You will work as part of a team, having the courage to challenge areas of concern and working to evidence based best practice. You will be reliable and consistent, taking responsibility for the integrity of your own actions and completed work.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You

individual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Treat people with dignity, respecting their choices, gaining valid consent for all treatments and respecting confidentiality.&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Put the patients’ interests first when taking clinical decisions, maintaining a caring approach towards them.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Take detailed dental, social and medical history and keep full, accurate and contemporaneous patient records.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out clinical examinations within your scope of practice, recognising abnormal oral mucosa(2)&#160;and related underlying structures and refer patients, where necessary.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Manage safety, infection control and decontamination risks around the clinical environment and the dental laboratory in keeping with current regulations.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Perform effective patient assessment, diagnosis and treatment planning.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate effective clinical decision making.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Give appropriate patient advice including patient referrals.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Provide clinical dental care as outlined in a treatment plan or prescription and plan the delivery in the most appropriate way.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Recognise and manage medical emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Legislation, policies and local ways of working related to your role&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;What valid consent, duty of care, safeguarding, diversity, equality and inclusion mean and why they are important&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The needs of different patient groups including children, adults, older people and those with special needs.&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Basic principles of population health, including demographic, social, UK and international oral health trends, determinants and inequalities of health and how they are measured.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;why it is important to record and store information securely and confidentially&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How to recognise abnormalities of the oral cavity, holistically and, when appropriate, raise concerns.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The range of normal human structures and functions with particular reference to oral disease and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The potential routes of transmission of infectious agents, mechanisms for prevention of infection, the scientific principles of decontamination and

technical and clinical dental procedures for providing removable dental appliances, including assessing the patient’s mouth and tissues, and discussing with them the range of dentures or other removable dental devices that would best meet their needs&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Take the appropriate impressions, ensuring they are fit for purpose&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Design, manufacture and fit biomechanically sound complete or partial dentures, devices and appliances for the oral cavity according to prescription&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Prescribe, provide or fit complete or partial dentures, sports mouth guards or other dental devices&#160;including using the agreed procedures in design and manufacture of custom made devices&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Advise the prescribing dentist on appropriate dental devices based on dentist input, while recognising oral limitations and their effect on devices.&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Evaluate the need for more complex treatment and seek advice from the prescribing dentist.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Review and quality assure the devices from the clinical standpoint, including repairing or modifying custom made clinical dental devices to meet the needs of the patient.&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;At the final fitting stage ensure that they are fit for purpose and the patient is aware of how to look after not only their dentures or other oral devices but their mouth in general. &#160;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Identify appropriate dental devices based on own
