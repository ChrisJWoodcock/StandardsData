  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation: Actuary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Actuaries work in a very niche industry with only approximately 450 qualifying each year. The actuarial profession however is still a diverse sector, working in the areas of insurance, pensions, healthcare, investment and the growing area of financial risk management. The role, responsibilities and exams that are required as an Actuary require individuals to stretch their abilities to a very high level. Actuaries use mathematical skills to measure the probability and risk of future events, and the financial impact on a business and/or individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Actuaries are highly regarded professionals who are both problem solvers and strategic thinkers and have a deep understanding of financial systems. Actuarial teams analyse data, build mathematical models to evaluate financial risks and communicate the output to non-specialists. The majority of actuaries work for insurance companies (life, health or general) or for financial or pensions consultancies. Insurance company actuaries typically work in areas such as pricing and product development, reserving, capital modelling and risk management. Work for insurance consultancy firms may be in similar areas but more varied on a day-to-day level. Amongst other things, pensions consultants advise private and public pension providers and trustees about the funding levels in their schemes and the contributions required to meet future pensions. They may also help their clients understand and manage the risks they face. However, an increasing number of actuaries are working in less traditional fields such as banking, investment management, corporate finance and anywhere where financial modelling is deemed useful. Actuaries are required to act in the public interest and must therefore maintain the highest standards of professional conduct and competency; upholding ethical behaviour and integrity at all times. An actuarial apprenticeship is a professional career route supported by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA). The apprenticeship will result in a breadth of knowledge, skills and behaviours, bringing wide and varied opportunities within this leading financial profession.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Entry Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst any entry requirements will be a matter for individual employers, typically an apprentice might be expected to have already achieved a degree in a numerate subject such as Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, Chemistry or Physics; a degree in a non-numerate subject with a Grade B in A-level Mathematics or equivalent; or to have successfully completed a Level 4 Actuarial Technician Apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Requirements: Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 142px;&quot;

Before apprentices can progress through the gateway, they must complete the Personal and Professional Development requirements of the IFoA Associateship level and pass IFoA exams: CT1 to CT9 (inclusive) and CA1 to CA3 (or the equivalent exams following the syllabus changes for the 2019 exams, &lt;em&gt;ie &lt;/em&gt;CS1-2, CM1-2, CB1-3, CP1-3).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On completion, apprentices are eligible to apply for Associateship membership of the IFoA, subject to completing any further requirements as required by the professional body. As well as ensuring full competency as an Actuary, this standard provides the foundation for progression into Fellowship of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard will be reviewed after three years.&lt;/p&gt;",
