  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupation Profile&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lifts are large mechanical and hydraulic devices used for moving people and goods (from palleted foodstuffs to large vehicles) vertically from one level to another in a building and similar situations. Escalators are mechanical, inclined moving stairways to transport people from one level to another, using moving steps. Moving walks are similar to escalators but instead of steps they use pallets that run horizontal or on an incline.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lift, Escalator and Moving Walk Electromechanics work in varying environments including domestic, retail and industrial buildings above and below ground. They carry out the installation or maintenance, repair and modernisation of lifts and escalators dependent upon the chosen specialism. They ensure that the lift or escalator performs within established parameters in line with the applicable codes and standards, historical and current, required by the UK Lift Regulations and/ or the EU Machinery Directive. They ensure the lift or escalator is safe for use and free from defects. The skills employed when conducting the work are of a complex nature and draw upon knowledge and experience of a wide range of equipment, mainly comprising mechanical traction or hydraulic systems of varying complexity operating at low, medium and high speeds, controlled by a microprocessor or analogue control technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lift, Escalator and Moving Walk Electromechanics install new, high-technology equipment, maintain and repair older equipment of varied age and technology, as well as undertaking modernization of lifts and escalators, replacing the majority of mechanical, hydraulic, electric and electronic parts to leave an up to date, modern machine in place. Other duties include; assembling, adjusting, aligning, calibrating and setting out electrical, electronic and mechanical components, interpreting wiring and layout diagrams specific to lifts and escalators and following safe systems of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Occupations&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The occupations covered by this Standard are associated with the installation, servicing, repair and refurbishment of lifts and escalators as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lift Installation Electromechanic&lt;/strong&gt;: Installing passenger/ goods carrying lift systems in new or existing buildings to industry specific quality standards for lifts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lift Service and Repair Electromechanic&lt;/strong&gt;: Maintenance, service and repair of existing passenger/ goods carrying lifts, ensuring that they function in line with manufacturer requirements.
