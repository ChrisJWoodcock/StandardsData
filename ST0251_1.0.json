  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Stairlift is a mechanism used for transporting less able persons up and down stairways. A Lifting Platform is a mechanism to raise a wheelchair and its occupant to overcome a step or similar vertical barrier. A Service Lift (also known as a Dumb‐waiter) is a mechanism used for transporting small goods from one floor to another&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stairlift, Lifting Platform and Service Lift Electromechanics work in varying environments including domestic, retail and industrial buildings above and below ground. They carry out the installation or maintenance and repair of stairlifts, lifting platforms and service lifts dependent upon the chosen specialism. They ensure that the stairlift, lifting platform or service lift performs within established parameters in line with the applicable codes and standards, historical and current, required by the EU Machinery Directive. They ensure the stairlift, lifting platform or service lift is safe for use and free from defects. The skills employed when conducting the work are of a complex nature and draw upon knowledge and experience of a wide range of equipment, mainly comprising mechanical traction or hydraulic systems of varying complexity operating at low and medium speeds, controlled by a microprocessor or analogue control technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stairlift, Lifting Platform and Service Lift Electromechanics install new, high-technology equipment, maintain and repair older equipment of varied age and technology. They carry out the assembly, diagnosis, repair and maintenance of mechanical, hydraulic and electrical and electronic components forming stairlifts, lifting platforms and service lifts, following safe systems of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They must adhere to safe working practices without endangering themselves or others and that the unit meets the requirements of the EU Machinery Directive. On completion of their work, the stairlift, lifting platform or service lift must be safe to use having received the appropriate sign off from a designated Stairlift, Lifting Platform and Service Lift Electromechanic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The apprentice will follow the Core Knowledge and Skills, and one of the Options given in Table 1. Training will be undertaken on all Core elements and on elements in the Option chosen by the apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 1 options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th colspan=&quot;6&quot;&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Option 1 – Stairlift Installation&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Option 2 – Stairlift Service and Repair&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Option 3 – Lifting Platform Installation&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Option 4 – Lifting Platform Service and Repair&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Option 5 -&#160; Service Lift Installation&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Option 6 -&#160; Service Lift Service and Repair&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Core knowledge, skills and behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge and understanding of:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Health, Safety and Environment&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Risk assessment, method statements and manufacturer instructions in relation to either installation, or service and repair.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Industry specific safety Standards and legislation, such as working at height and electrical isolation methods in respect of one’s own safety and of others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Correct use of personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\nEnvironmental recycling/ disposal processes.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apply risk assessments and implement risk control measures.&lt;/p&gt;\nFollow method statements in relation to specific work activities work responsibly in safety‐critical environments.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Mechanical Stairlift, Lifting Platform and Service Lift Technology&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;The principles and operation of components making a Stairlift, Lifting Platform or Service Lift system.
