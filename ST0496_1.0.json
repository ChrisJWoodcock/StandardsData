The experience gained and responsibility held by the apprentice on completion of the apprenticeship will either wholly or partially satisfy the requirements for IEng.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Apprenticeship Standard will be reviewed after 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;",
