  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Profile for Commercial Procurement &amp;amp; Supply Roles&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The work of procurement and supply professionals includes the process of procurement, or buying goods and services; however, these roles can be much broader than just procurement. These roles can extend to a huge range of related commercial activity such as influencing policy, financial analysis, engaging in contract law, and developing strategy to deliver services. The variety of goods and services that procurement professionals are responsible for is vast: goods could range from buying a plane to negotiating new stationery supply. Securing services could include: finding new and innovative IT systems, outsourcing translation services or closing a deal on a construction project for a new building.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Encompassing the entire procurement cycle, achieving the Level 4 in Procurement and Supply will enable an individual to use their breadth and depth of experience to position themselves as a fully effective commercially skilled professional with transferable skills and career options that span the public, private and charitable sectors. This will be supported by the attainment of a Level 4 Diploma with the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp;amp; Supply (CIPS).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typical job roles in this area include: Commercial support, Commercial analyst, Sourcing executive, Procurement operations support, Buyer, assistant buyer, Commercial relationship support, Commissioning and Performance monitoring officer, Framework management support, Contract associate, Contract support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The following explains the knowledge, skills and behaviours required from a successful individual on completion of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Context of procurement and supply&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How an organisation’s money is spent, including the organisation’s own rules on managing budgets.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The difference between public and private sector procurement life-cycles and how they fit into the&#160;organisation’s structure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pre- procurement and early market engagement&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Show understanding of the market, regulatory environment, supplier and service landscape before beginning the tendering process. Whilst knowing about the ability to utilise market and commodity intelligence, including supplier innovation, customer requirement and how the use of internal and external data can support the development of a robust business case.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cost and pricing models and commercial concepts and how they influence supplier/customer behaviours.&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Financial awareness that enables a focus on achieving efficiencies and continuous improvement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recognise business needs that shape decisions, for example financial restrictions or time requirements. Show how such business objectives are articulated in procurement specifications using a set of appropriate tools/techniques e.g. LEAN sourcing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sourcing and contract agreements&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The principles and purpose of commercial contracting and how contract terms, conditions and obligations affect delivery and supplier performance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand sustainability risks and opportunities associated with sourcing decisions. Know that these decisions assist with conducting pre-procurement market engagement to make sure the requirement is deliverable, clear and attractive to suppliers whilst also offering maximum value for money.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Different procurement and contractual models e.g. use of SMEs, mutual and joint ventures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The use of the different types of documentation and terminology that frequently form part of the commercial contract process, e.g. the contract and its appendices.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The aims of and tactics and techniques for successful negotiation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Supplier management&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The organisation’s commercial strategy and policies, procedures and governance mechanisms.&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The principles and purpose of contract governance, risk management and the internal controls within their own organisation and conduct work within those frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A range of supplier performance monitoring, management and reporting techniques to ensure that cost, service, quality and sustainability objectives are being achieved.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The need to develop strong collaborative relationships with customer, supplier and stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What techniques to use to add value through building positive commercial relationships and trust.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to forecast and plan requirements with internal stakeholders and suppliers to ensure the supply of goods and services matches demand taking into account actual demand.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Both national and international contractual and procedural procurement law.
