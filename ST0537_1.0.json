Dependent on the sector that they are employed in there may be subtle differences in terms of composition and application of the job role specific skills and knowledge they will require, however the core skills and knowledge will be the same regardless of the sector/area they work in.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Engineering Operatives will have clear reporting lines with anything outside their role and responsibility. They will work individually or as part of a team to carry out a range of engineering operations which could include ensuring machines and equipment used are maintained and serviceable, dealing with breakdowns, restoring components and systems to serviceable condition by repair and replacement; operating a variety of machines (CNC or Conventional); assembling and repairing machine and press tools, dies, jigs, fixtures and other tools; fabrication/installation of a wide variety of other sheet fabrications and equipmentand;

– Reflect on skills, knowledge and behaviours and seek opportunities to develop, adapt to different situations, environments or technologies and have a positive attitude to feedback and advice.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their Apprenticeships.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration of Apprenticeship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 12 to 18 months `&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandatory Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;All apprentices undertaking this apprenticeship must achieve:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandatory qualifications:&lt;/strong&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Diploma in engineering operations (skills)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ofqual regulated&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Level of qualification: 2&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Certificate or Diploma in engineering operations (knowledge)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Ofqual regulated&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Level of qualification: 2&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without Level 1 (or equivalent) in English and maths must ensure that apprentices achieve Level 1 and take the test for Level 2 prior to taking the end-point assessment. For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement the apprenticeships English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3 and British Sign Language qualification are an alternative to English qualifications for whom this is their primary language.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This Apprenticeship Standard will be reviewed after three years.&lt;/p&gt;",
