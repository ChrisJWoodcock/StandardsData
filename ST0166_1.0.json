  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For over 4000 years we have worked in partnership with horses and cared for their needs. There are about a million horses (including all domestic equine species, namely horses, ponies, donkeys and their hybrids) kept for recreation and commercial use in the UK. The Equine Groom is a fundamental occupational role in all equine businesses, and vital to an industry that contributes over &#163;8bn to the British economy each year. Horse industries are steeped in tradition, yet embrace innovation and technology.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices will be entering a vocational industry, where they can expect to handle a variety of horses in different working environments. They must adhere to safe working practices, be prepared to work in all weather conditions and often in “out of hours” situations. They will be required to have dedication, commitment and the physical and mental toughness to cope with the rigours of the role. Living on site for part or all of the duration of the apprenticeship may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The occupation requires competent individuals who are committed to the safety and welfare of the horses in their care. They will use their theoretical knowledge and understanding, practical experience and empathy to maintain the horses’ physical and psychological well-being within a safe working environment. This is a practical, “hands on” occupation where apprentices will work under supervision individually or as part of a diverse team. The Equine Groom is an integral part in the life of the horse, providing essential day-to-day care. They will be involved with feeding, grooming, cleaning equipment, handling, preparing, exercising the horses and carrying out routine yard duties.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Equine Groom may also be required to assist with the preparation of, transport to and care for horses at competitions, the races, sales, shows and other public appearances. Dependent on which sector of the industry the Equine Groom has chosen, appropriate people skills will be essential.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Equine Groom apprentice will need to decide in which sector of the industry they wish to progress and select the appropriate occupational route.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On completion of the apprenticeship, newly qualified Equine Grooms will possess the CORE&#160;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;KNOWLEDGE&lt;/span&gt; to understand:-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On completion of the apprenticeship, newly qualified Equine Grooms will have proven CORE &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;SKILLS&lt;/span&gt; enabling them to competently:-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe Working Practices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;Current health, safety and security requirements, policies and procedures including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
