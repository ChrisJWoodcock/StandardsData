  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the following document, the term “energetics” is used to describe hazardous materials such as explosives, propellants and pyrotechnics. Reference is also made to energetic items, which are devices containing energetic materials that are designed to function in a particular manner.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An Ordnance Munitions and Explosives career is challenging, stimulating and dynamic. A fully competent OME Professional can work in a wide range of organisations, including defence, chemical, commercial, military, security, nuclear and analytical services (from multi-nationals to SMEs) and government bodies (e.g. MoD). Although there is close collaboration between these organisations, the needs and requirements are different for each. OME professionals working within one of these organisations may move between government and industry and, as such, are central to maintaining national security now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An OME Professional can carry out a range of technical, engineering and scientific activities which may include laboratory based investigations, engineering studies and scientific experimentation in their specialist field. They will analyse, interpret and evaluate technical information, concepts and ideas and use these to develop subsequent products, experiments or investigations and to propose solutions to problems.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;They can apply knowledge of underlying OME principles to implement new processes according to the literature or input from senior team members. They can work autonomously and as part of a wider specialist team, taking responsibility for the quality of the work that is undertaken and deliver value to their organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;They are proactive in finding solutions to problems, can identify areas of business improvement and propose innovative ideas. In all contexts working safely and ethically is paramount. All OME professionals are required to operate under highly regulated conditions because of the need to control safety and quality.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This integrated degree apprenticeship follows a core and option model. The options within the apprenticeship are:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Technical Research and Development Professional&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Safety Professional&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing and Processing Professional&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Breakdown and Disposal Professional&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Test and Evaluation Professional&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Each OME professional will have core knowledge/skills that are common to all, and specific knowledge/skills required for their specialist option. An OME professional will be confident, competent and capable of working within their particular domain and of collaborating effectively with other OME professionals in parallel sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of the work within the sector, most employers require employees to be 18 years of age or above. Individual employers will set the selection criteria, but this is likely to include three ‘A’ levels, including maths, although some employers will accept other relevant qualifications or experience.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All OME Professionals require a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The requirement to prevent fire or explosion, limit the extent of fire or explosion and protect persons from the effects of fire or explosion.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Security provisions relating to explosives; including preventing the unauthorised access and acquisition of explosives.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The requirements for traceability, record keeping and reporting a loss of explosives.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Environmental requirements associated with an OME lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How to develop and apply a theoretical and practical knowledge of the physics and chemistry of energetic materials, from the laboratory scale through to final item.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Underlying engineering/material science to implement product lifecycle processes.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How to apply mathematical methods and modelling to support technical design and analysis using the principles of analysis and interpretation of experimental data.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The evaluation of OME concepts and designs.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The implications of change in design and/or manufacturing processes of both energetic materials and items to ensure product quality and safety.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Emerging technologies and applications together with a broader view of how they can be used within the OME environment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Implement safety and environmental requirements to the OME industry lifecycle and all other tasks.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The internal and external regulatory environment pertinent to the sector.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The business environment in which their company operates including their role within the organisation, ethical practice and codes of conduct&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Project management procedures and how to incorporate these into the OME work environment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The requirements of internal or external customers and how to recommend the appropriate workflows, improvements or OME solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All OME Professionals can:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Implement measures to prevent unplanned fire or explosion, limit the extent of fire or explosion and protect people from the effects of a fire or explosion.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Implement measures to prevent unauthorised people having access to locations where explosives are manufactured, stored or kept or to explosives themselves.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Implement measures to protect the environment throughout the OME lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Identify and develop solutions to OME based problems and areas of improvement, proposing innovative ideas (e.g. Routes to lessening armour weight).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Use scientific/engineering and commercial knowledge to take an OME idea from concept to implementation.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Explore, develop and recommend initiatives that support and improve existing OME performance (e.g. obsolescence management or new technology introduction).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Implement a safe system of work via interpretation of hazard data, identification of environmental effects and potentially dangerous events.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Share acquired knowledge, including safety, technical aspects and mentorship.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Interpret and implement industry standards, procedures and specifications (e.g. National Occupational Standards and NATO Standardisation Agreement).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to longer term technical planning, customer requirements and participate in business case creation (e.g. Strategic Defence Review and Defence White Paper).&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Procure and operate OME according to explosives regulations.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and implement business directed plans and strategies to time, cost and quality requirements using the knowledge of relevant aspects of their company.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Innovate and adapt within the boundaries of your responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Act ethically and with integrity&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Engage and take responsibility for your personal development&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate commitment to learning and self-improvement and be open to feedback&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Work autonomously and as part of a wider team&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Take responsibility for the quality and safety of work&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Environmentally responsible approach&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Work within the limits of your experience and knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research and Development Professionals are responsible for:&lt;/strong&gt;

  "occupationalSummary": "An Ordnance Munitions and Explosives career is challenging, stimulating and dynamic. A fully competent OME Professional can work in a wide range of organisations, including defence, chemical, commercial, military, security, nuclear and analytical services (from multi-nationals to SMEs) and government bodies (e.g. MoD). Although there is close collaboration between these organisations, the needs and requirements are different for each. OME professionals working within one of these organisations may move between government and industry and, as such, are central to maintaining national security now and in the future.\r\n\r\nAn OME Professional can carry out a range of technical, engineering and scientific activities which may include laboratory based investigations, engineering studies and scientific experimentation in their specialist field. They will analyse, interpret and evaluate technical information, concepts and ideas and use these to develop subsequent products, experiments or investigations and to propose solutions to problems.\r\n\r\nThey can apply knowledge of underlying OME principles to implement new processes according to the literature or input from senior team members. They can work autonomously and as part of a wider specialist team, taking responsibility for the quality of the work that is undertaken and deliver value to their organisation.\r\n\r\nThey are proactive in finding solutions to problems, can identify areas of business improvement and propose innovative ideas. In all contexts working safely and ethically is paramount. All OME professionals are required to operate under highly regulated conditions because of the need to control safety and quality.\r\n",
