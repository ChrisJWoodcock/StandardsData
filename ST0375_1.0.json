Other duties will include guiding and controlling the movement and operation of plant, machinery and vehicles; preparing, checking and maintaining machinery and equipment in use.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 487px;&quot; width=&quot;487&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core

activities&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;work safely underground, follow safe tunnel entry systems and react appropriately in an emergency following the correct emergency escape procedures&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;interpret and work to specifications including Control of Substances Hazardous to Health [COSHH]assessments, construction information and briefings&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;plan and undertake work productively&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;communicate with others and follow organisational procedures to conform to productive work

environmentally responsible work practices and contribute to sustainable practices in tunnelling operations&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;follow the technical requirements, at an operative level, associated with the different tunnelling processes and/or methods for one of the following; hand tunnelling, machine tunnelling (loco operator), pipejacking, sprayed concrete lining, shaft sinking and drill and blast, plan and use appropriate technologies associated with the different processes and/or methods&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;apply safe working techniques for moving and handling materials, resources
