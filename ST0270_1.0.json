Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This occupation involves installing a range of roofing materials and products, at height.&#160; It includes interpreting drawings, measuring and calculating the required amount of materials.&#160; Roofing work can involve anything from repairing a single tile or slate on a domestic property, to re-roofing public buildings such as schools, working on new build housing projects, or installing the roof on large commercial buildings.&#160; Roofers can be on site from a few hours to a few weeks so this occupation should suit those who like to move workplaces on a regular basis.&#160; The work is varied and would suit individuals who prefer working outside.&#160; This is a core and options apprenticeship, with three options:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Option 1: A Roof Slater and Tiler works on a building site, or in domestic or commercial premises, installing slate and tile roof coverings and related products to both new and existing buildings.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Option 2: A Waterproof Membranes Installer works on a building site, or in domestic or commercial premises, installing waterproofing systems and related products, to both new and existing buildings.&#160; Waterproofing roofers apply protective membranes to flat roof structures to ensure they are watertight.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Option 3: A Roof Sheeter and Cladder works on commercial premises, installing metal sheet roof coverings and related products, to both new and existing buildings.&#160; Roof sheeting and cladding operatives make buildings waterproof by covering the roof with sheeting, operatives may also clad walls.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Core Skills&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On completion of this apprenticeship, roofers will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Work safely and be aware of key health, safety and welfare issues&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Plan and carry out their work to commercial standards of quality and speed&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Move, handle and store resources, complying with relevant legislation and guidance&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Interpret and follow verbal and written work instructions from trade supervisors and site managers&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Select the required materials and resources to carry out the work&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Set up, check and operate plant and/or equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Install related materials and components to a given specification&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Use, maintain and store hand tools, power tools and associated equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Access, interpret and use drawings and specifications to carry out work&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On completion of this apprenticeship, a roofer will have knowledge of:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The principles of health, safety and welfare, employment law, and how these are applied in the workplace&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The different techniques and methods used to move, handle and store materials&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How to interpret and use relevant product information and specifications&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The standards and codes of practice that apply to roofing&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How to calculate quantity, length, area and wastage of resources&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The principles of condensation, the factors involved and standard methods of control in roofs&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The principles of insulation and effects on heat loss in roofs&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Basic drawings and how to calculate material quantities from given information&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The principles relating to common defects, and the repair and maintenance of roofs&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Why, when and how health and safety control equipment should be used when undertaking roofing work (e.g. personal protective equipment (PPE) and respiratory protective equipment (RPE)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How to use, maintain and store hand tools, power tools and associated equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How to work safely at height and use access equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The needs of other workers and how to work effectively with others&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The characteristics, quality, uses, sustainability, limitations and defects associated with roofing products and&#160;components used in their own specialism and the wider roofing industry&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core behaviours expected to be displayed by all roofing apprentices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective communication:&lt;/strong&gt; oral, written, listening, body language,
