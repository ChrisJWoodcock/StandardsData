  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Section 1: Occupational profile for a poultry worker&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The agriculture industry offers exciting and varied careers in the UK and abroad providing unique opportunities for young people to work in a technically advanced and innovative environment, producing one of the country’s most important products – food. Businesses within the industry range from small family farms through to large integrated organisations working across the food supply chain. The key role for a poultry worker is to raise the animals with optimal welfare and consideration for their needs throughout the different stages of their life. This is practical work involving a combination of technology and manual labour. Being a poultry worker requires compassion, self-motivation and the ability to work both independently and as a team player. Poultry workers will be responsible for their own work, but will have close supervision. As animal welfare is a priority on farm, key to being a good poultry worker is understanding your limits and knowing when to ask for help. A poultry worker is responsible for supporting the bird development process, maintaining bird accommodation and preparing and monitoring the livestock production environment whether this is on a farm or in a hatchery. This will include ensuring they are looked after to meet health and welfare requirements as well as performance targets while maintaining effective biosecurity at site. This standard follows a ‘core and options’ approach. The core covers the generic requirements for looking after birds competently and the sector options provide more specific needs for different stages of the process, rearing, breeding and egg laying, hatchery and grow out farms. These are permanent stages in the process and not seasonal roles. To complete the standard a Poultry Worker should complete the core elements and one option.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One option will be taken in addition to the core knowledge, skills and behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Section 2: The essential core knowledge, skills and behaviours for a poultry worker&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The statements in a, b and c below describe the essential core knowledge, skills and behaviours of a poultry worker. Poultry workers will possess the following CORE knowledge of the:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant species/breed, its characteristics, behaviours, production cycle, and welfare requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Importance of food safety including personal hygiene and good hygiene practice and procedures for the relevant site environment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Health and safety requirements for the individual and the workplace including relevant company procedures and legislative standards.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Safe and effective methods of operating and maintaining equipment appropriate to the site environment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Importance of good site biosecurity and the procedures and controls that have to be in place to maintain it including general security rules relevant to the site.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Correct diet and water requirements relevant to the species and point in the life cycle and the impact of any change.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Correct environmental conditions relevant to the species and point in the life cycle and the impact of any change.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Correct procedures for humane culling, storing and disposal.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Correct procedures for handling, storing, moving and transporting birds/eggs.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant welfare codes of practice including the five freedoms, (Freedom from hunger and thirst, Freedom from discomfort, Freedom from pain, injury or disease, Freedom to express normal behaviour, Freedom from fear and distress by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The impact of the poultry worker on welfare.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Signals and behaviours to look for that indicate health or welfare issues and the actions required to mitigate them.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Business/industry and legislative requirements including industry assurance standards.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Methods for stock control, record keeping and reporting.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant costs, waste management procedures, bird metrics and site targets necessary to deliver effective performance.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant technology appropriate to the process, for example controls and software.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Poultry workers will be competent in the following CORE skills&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works in a safe manner and maintains a safe working environment.
