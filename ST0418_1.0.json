  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Section 1: Occupational profile for an Abattoir worker&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The UK abattoir industry slaughters over 26m units of livestock each year yielding in the region of 2m tonnes of red carcase worth a net contribution of &#163;1.67b to the economy. The food industry defines meat obtained from mammals (regardless of cut or age) as &lt;strong&gt;red meat, &lt;/strong&gt;this is because it contains more myoglobin than white meat obtained from poultry and fish.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Abattoir workers must hold a valid licence to operate, which is known as a certificate of competence in order to comply with the Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (WATOK) legislation, issued by the Food Standards Agency. Individuals must be over 18 years to obtain a certificate of competence, which entitles them to work in specified areas monitored by the official veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;From receiving animals in the strictly controlled handling (lairage) facility and through the slaughter process, abattoir workers need to be empathetic and respectful of animals. Team work and diligence is part and parcel of the role as well as upholding professional behavioural standards in accordance with Standard Operating Procedures. Those with aptitude and dedication can progress to managing the slaughter-line or cutting/de-boning operations, becoming an Animal Welfare Officer (AWO).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Section 2: Abattoir workers – The knowledge, skills and behaviours&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge, in the context of one red meat species chosen from cattle, horses, sheep/goats, pigs, large game an abattoir worker must understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The historical development of the red meat slaughter industry leading up to the modern day and the key business principles that sustain abattoir businesses and make them sucessful&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The process and procedure for receiving animals into, and their movement around, the lairage facility.

In addition, the management of regulatory control applicable to workers in the specified roles identified within the regulated and WATOK legislated operation&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The process and function in the slaughter process of penning/restraint: stunning, shackling, hoisting, bleeding and safe use of relevant equipment/machinery.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The requirements for safe, efficient and hygienic practices in the bleeding of animals, religious slaughter as practised by halal and kosher religious groups&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The importance for efficient and correct use of machinery such as hide puller in the processes of hygienic flaying/depilation (de-hairing) and in the dressing activity&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The importance of and how to ensure accurate cutting and incision lines in the evisceration process and the need to minimise and control potential high risk contamination areas.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The designated location and value of the animal by-product and offal removed during the dressing process, alongside knowledge and use of red and green offal including by product categorisation and the legislative requirement for Specified Risk Material (SRM).&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The regulatory food safety and hygiene systems within the food chain applicable to and embedded in abattoir operations, and the need for all employees to be trained in the production of wholesome quality meat.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Employment rights and responsibilities: equality and diversity, team working practices and the importance of continuous personal development.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;b.
