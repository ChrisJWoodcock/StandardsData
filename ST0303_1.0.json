Plumbing and Domestic Heating Technicians are at the forefront of installing new and exciting environmental technologies like heat pumps, solar thermal systems, biomass boilers and water recycling systems. It is important for a plumbing and heating technician to be able to work independently or as a team and use their knowledge and skills to ensure that both the system and appliances are appropriately selected and correctly installed, often without any supervision, and done so in a safe, efficient and economical manner to minimise waste.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Core Knowledge and Skills Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 133px;&quot; width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 406px;&quot; width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Health and safety&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Understand health and safety legislation, codes of practice and safe working practices&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Core plumbing systems&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Understand selection, planning, installation, testing, commissioning and de-commissioning, service, maintenance, fault diagnosis and repair techniques on cold water, hot water, central heating, above ground drainage and rainwater systems&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Electrical components and control systems&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Understand installation and testing techniques for electrical components and control systems on plumbing and domestic heating systems&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Plumbing science and processes&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Understand scientific plumbing, domestic heating and mechanical principles&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Principles of environmental technology systems&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Understand the principles of domestic mechanical environmental technology systems&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Principles of fossil fuels&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Understand the principles of fuel combustion, ventilation and fluing arrangements within a domestic environment&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Customer service&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Understand the principles of high quality customer service and establishing the needs of others (colleagues, customers and other stakeholders).
