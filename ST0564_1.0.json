  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced Clinical Practitioners are experienced clinicians who demonstrate expertise in their scope of practice. Advanced Clinical Practitioners manage defined episodes of clinical care independently, from beginning to end, providing care and treatment from the time an individual(1) first presents through to the end of the episode, which may include admission, referral or discharge or care at home. They carry out their full range of duties in relation to individuals’ physical and mental healthcare and in acute, primary, urgent and emergency settings (including hospitals, general practice, individuals’ homes, schools and prisons, and in the public, independent, private and charity sectors). They combine expert clinical skills with research, education and clinical leadership within their scope of practice. Advanced Clinical Practitioners work innovatively on a one to one basis with individuals as well as part of a wider team. They work as part of the wider health and social care team and across traditional professional boundaries in health and social care.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities and duties: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As an Advanced Clinical Practitioner, you will:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Have a high level of autonomy(2) and freedom to make decisions about how people should be cared for a treated and act in complex and unpredictable situations&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Use person-centred approaches to taking an individual’s detailed history and examine body systems to help you make a diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Select, undertake or request a range of appropriate clinical tests and assessments to help you make a diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Initiate and evaluate a range of interventions, which may include for example prescribing of medicines, therapies and care&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Apply a skillset that may have traditionally been the remit of other disciplines so that you can enhance the care and experience of individuals&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Analyse, interpret and act on the results of clinical tests and assessments and formulate a plan of care, which may include admission to a care setting such as a hospital, referral to settings for another opinion or discharge from services&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Drive service improvements, educate others and provide consultancy services within your scope of practice&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Undertake research activities to develop new knowledge and undertake audit to evaluate and further develop your area of expertise to improve care and services for the people you are treating&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices must complete a Master’s degree in Advanced Clinical Practice.
