They will interpret simple design requirements for discrete components of the project under supervision. The approach will typically include implementing code, which other team members have developed, to produce the required component. . The Software Development Technician will also be engaged in testing that the specific component meets its intended functionality.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical job roles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Software Development Technician&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Junior Developer, Junior Web Developer, Junior Application Developer, Junior Mobile App Developer, Junior Games Developer, Junior Software Developer, Junior Application Support Analyst, Junior Programmer, Assistant Programmer and Automated Test Developer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;try requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria, but this is likely to include 5 GCSEs (especially English, mathematics and a science or technology subject);
