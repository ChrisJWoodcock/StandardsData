Systems Engineers integrate multiple technological elements in complex systems that, in the case of socio-technical systems, may also include organisational elements and human interactions. &#160;Socio-technical systems include requirements that span hardware, software, personnel, and community aspects (e.g. a rail network includes human considerations at many different levels).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with project managers or personnel from business development and/or sales functions. They may assemble and manage teams of domain specialists (such as mechanical, electrical, electronics, software engineers, etc.) and subject matter experts in specific technology or scientific areas. A Systems Engineer will often work in a customer-facing role ensuring that the system meets customer and user needs and preferences, often with responsibility for technical and business communication. &#160;Mostly the occupation is office-based, although site visits may be needed during implementation of designed systems.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for overall technical management and coordination within a programme or project and contribute to safety, security and quality of outputs.&#160; They may be responsible for specific processes within the lifecycle as, for example, a Requirements Engineer, Systems Architect, or Integration Engineer.&#160; For larger programmes or projects, Systems Engineers will typically be responsible for staff and budgets.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jobs typically held by individuals undertaking this occupation include Lead Engineer, Project Engineer, Technical Lead, Acquisition Engineer; Systems Engineer; Test Engineer; Requirements Engineer; Requirements Manager, Systems Architect, Systems Designer, Systems Analyst, Engineering Manager, Systems Specialist, Technical Manager, in-service Engineer, Through-life Systems Engineer, Operation and Support Engineer, Acceptance Engineer, Integration Engineer, Interface Manager.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Duties:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1. Define and manage the system lifecycle for a project&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. Define and manage project requirements&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. Manage project risk&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. Model and analyse systems&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;5. Generate solution concepts&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;6. Architect and design systems&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;7. Plan and manage systems integration&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;8. Plan and execute system verification&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;9. Plan and execute system validation&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;10. Provide technical leadership within a project&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;11. Support transition of the system into the operational environment&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;12. Provide systems-level in-service support of the system&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;13. Support technical aspects of project management&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;14. Take responsibility for configuration and data management&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;15. Co-ordinate technical outputs and work of multi-disciplinary teams&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge, Skills, Behaviours&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To carry out the duties of a systems engineer, the following knowledge is required:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;K1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;STEM&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn2&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;qualification and 2 years relevant experience, or a level 5 STEM qualification and 5 years relevant experience, or a level 3 or 4 STEM qualification and 10 years relevant experience.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;English and maths&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without English and maths at level 2 or above will need to achieve this level prior to undertaking the end-point assessment. For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement the apprenticeship’s English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3. British Sign Language qualification is an alternative to English qualifications for those whom this is their primary language.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 48 months&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Master’s degree in Systems Engineering&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Professional Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Systems Engineers who successfully complete the apprenticeship will achieve the standard of Practitioner against a selected profile of the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) competences as detailed in the Assessment Plan. The apprenticeship also provides a route towards the knowledge, experience and competence required to apply for recognition by INCOSE as a Certified Systems Engineering Professional (CSEP) and to apply to be registered by the Engineering Council as a Chartered Engineer (CEng).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Engineering and Manufacturing&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 years&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftnref1&quot; name=&quot;_ftn1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;Qualification levels are defined at:&lt;span&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels&quot;&gt;https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftnref2&quot; name=&quot;_ftn2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics&lt;/blockquote&gt;",
