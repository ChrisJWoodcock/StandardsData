  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ccupational Profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Metrology Technician&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a level 3 Apprenticeship&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Metrology is the science of measurement and includes all theoretical and practical aspects of measurement. Measurement underpins the UK economy and international trade. Each year in the UK over&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#163;600 billion worth of goods and utilities are sold based on the measurement of their quantity and quality. Metrology takes place across a wide range of industries as diverse as advanced manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, construction, energy, environment, pharma and healthcare and space and within all sizes of organisation. Important measurement activities can range from measuring galaxies to graphene, molecules, chemical pollutants, hip joints, aircraft, industrial emissions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This important work is carried out by skilled Metrology Technicians who understand core measurement principles and practices and whose role is to interpret and apply these whilst carrying out measurement activities in whichever industry they work. They are also able to identify measurement needs and plan and perform measurement tasks using tools, equipment, instrumentation and software programs. Metrology is vital to improve the quality and throughput of goods and utilities, which in turn is essential to increasing productivity and customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Metrology Technicians must comply with statutory regulations and health and safety requirements. They will be able to carry out work with minimal supervision, take responsibility for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake, and will have a high level of attention to detail. The successful apprentice will become a valuable measurement specialist, within their organisation, significantly contributing to the future of the Metrology industry and the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Roles may include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Technicians associated with Measurement research; Instrument &amp;amp; equipment use, Calibration, Test, Inspection and type approval; Measurement application in field, Laboratory or Manufacturing; and Quality and process support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;l&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;g&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e – the understanding of:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1. The principles of metrology and their application within industry, law, business, science and society, including; measurement units, capability, traceability and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. Safe working practices and legislation, regulation, industry and organisational policies, procedures and requirements relating to health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3. The commercial environment in which the organisation operates, the national and international regulations and standards, industry and organisational procedures and requirements relating to metrology codes of conduct and the importance of their application.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4. Quality requirements, assurance, verification, inspection, accreditation, audit systems and processes, why these are important and their role in Metrology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;5. The measuring environment, the potential sources of uncertainty, the impact on data collection, analysis, interpretation and results.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;6. The appropriate mathematical techniques including; statistics, process control methodologies, measurement systems analysis, data analysis, trend analysis, algebraic expressions, formulae and calculations required to perform measurement tasks.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kills – the ability to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1. Identify measurement needs and make informed decisions about the measurement process and timescales required, including selection of; tools, equipment, instrumentation and software programs.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. Access and interpret information and documentation to support the measurement process including; data, manuals, specifications, catalogues, calibration certificates and computer-generated information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3. Prepare the work environment and perform tests and checks on measurement tools, equipment, instrumentation and software programs and determine suitability for use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4. Take action when non-conforming tools, equipment, instrumentation, materials and software programs have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;5. Plan and perform measurement tasks to ensure verifiable results, using measurement tools, equipment, instrumentation and software programs, following specified procedures and methodologies.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;6. Retrieve, analyse, interpret, validate and record measurement results and data in line with specifications.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;7. Contribute to the production of records, reports and other measurement documentation.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;8.
