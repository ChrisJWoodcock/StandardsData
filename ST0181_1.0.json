For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeship’s English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3. A British Sign Language (BSL) qualification is an alternative to the English qualification for those whose primary language is BSL&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to professional registration and progression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Completion of the Investment Operations Certificate enables the apprentice to apply for Associate Member status in the CISI.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship can either be an entry level role, or a progression from a lower level, building on the knowledge and skills gained previously. &#160;On completion, the employee will be fully competent in the role and this will form the foundation of a career in the sector and the opportunity to start to specialise in a particular area such as ISA Administration, Global Custody, and Settlements. There are a range of options beyond this apprenticeship including the Level 4 Trailblazer apprenticeship if appropriate for the employer, and separately, there are a range of qualifications available for further study up to degree level.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 3 apprenticeship&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 years or when significant change is required&lt;/p&gt;",
