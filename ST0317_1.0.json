  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Rail Engineering Operatives provide support to Rail Technicians and Engineers. The engineering disciplines cover the following areas of “The Railway” (infrastructure and trains); track (including minor works), electrification, overhead line, signalling, telecommunications and traction &amp;amp; rolling stock. Apprentices will undertake the core learning and also specialise in one particular discipline.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Those working within the occupation of Rail Engineering are responsible for the safe construction, installation, maintenance and renewal of The Railway to provide a safe and reliable Railway for customers. The Rail Industry has a high level of safety critical work activities requiring a disciplined and responsible approach.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job titles include: &lt;/strong&gt;Track Operative, Overhead Line Operative, Electrification Operative, Traction &amp;amp; Rolling Stock Operative, Signalling Operative, Telecoms Operative.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Rail Engineering Operative may work on site or in a depot or in a technical office. Their work could involve:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Assisting in the construction, installation, renewal, enhancement and modification of The Railway.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Assisting with fault finding and diagnosis to prevent or address equipment failures.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Maintenance and replacement of components.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Assisting in functional and operational testing and inspection of The Railway using specialist equipment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;For those Rail Engineering Operatives who have the ability and drive there is a wide range of further development and career progression opportunities within Rail Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their Apprenticeships. Employers who recruit candidates without English or Maths at Grade C or above must ensure that the candidate achieves a level 1 English and Maths and take the test for level 2 prior to taking the end point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Within a Rail context all Rail Engineering Operatives need to know about:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;afe and Professional working practices &lt;/strong&gt;including legislation, regulation, industry procedures and safety requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;h&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e general engineering techniques &lt;/strong&gt;required to support the maintenance, renewal and construction of The Railway.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to work effectively and contribute to engineering solutions &lt;/strong&gt;including awareness of the importance of 3rd party requirement and the need to understand and adhere to corporate policies on ethics, equality and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;w&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eness of commercial principles &lt;/strong&gt;applicable to The Railway, and the implications of these.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Within a Rail context all Rail Engineering Operatives need to be able to:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep themselves and others safe by adhering to safe working practices&lt;/strong&gt;. Understand and comply with statutory regulations and organisational safety requirements, including safe access to work locations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;epare for a high standard of technical work: &lt;/strong&gt;Gathering and interpreting information including drawings, plans and schedules needed for rail engineering activities and prepare the work location.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliver a high standard of technical work: &lt;/strong&gt;Undertake engineering activities in relation to maintenance, construction / installation and or renewal of assets.
