  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role / Occupation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Learning Mentor (LM)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Minimum 12 months&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mentoring is - and has been for centuries - the foundation of vocational training and apprenticeships, yet this standard is the first formal recognition of this role.&#160; Nowadays, mentoring takes place in all parts of the Education and Training Sector (ETS) and staff-development contexts. LMs support learners of all ages, and all levels, to develop within a new work role.&#160; These learners may be, for example, apprentices, trainees or new recruits (ranging from young entrants, to new CEOs) in the workplace, or in any vocational learning environment.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;LMs will have sector-specific experience and qualifications, as determined by their employer or professional body, which they use to guide and advise those who are less experienced and new to a work role. The LM is therefore a ‘dual professional’ having both up-to-date knowledge and skills in a specialist vocational or subject area, together with the generic skills necessary to support learners (as potentially a first step towards a secondary role as an education and training professional).&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;LMs therefore support the development of learners’ knowledge, skills and behaviours, throughout their programme, particularly in applying theoretical learning in practical work environments (and usually on a one-to-one, or small group, basis). They give practical, technical and/or pastoral support and guidance.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;LMs collaborate closely with colleagues, other ETS professional, employers and/or human resource colleagues to meet learners’ needs and achieve their potential.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The LM apprenticeship requires development of the following professional behaviours, knowledge and skills:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Within the sector, ‘mentoring’ is understood to be different to ‘coaching’; being a relatively basic learning-support role, involving advice and guidance delivered by a more experienced person.&#160; (See the Level 4 Assessor-Coach Standard for further clarification about these two different roles.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;&#160;&lt;strong&gt;Professional behaviours. The Learning Mentor will:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Promote an ethos of motivation, aspiration and a passion for learning&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Operate at all times to ethical and legal standards and within professional boundaries&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Value equality and diversity and work with others to improve equality of opportunity and inclusion&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Be resilient and adaptable when dealing with challenge and change, maintaining focus and self-control&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate, encourage and expect mutual respect in all professional contexts&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Learning Mentor will be able to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Learning Mentor will understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide mentoring support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procedures for effective mentoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;S1&#160;

Those that have not must achieve this prior to taking the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Outcomes for this standard must include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Level 1 Safeguarding&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Employers may also wish candidates to achieve appropriate additional qualifications in Education and Training including mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The above outcomes will be achieved before the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Progression&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The LM could progress further within their vocation specialism and/or into roles involving the assessment and coaching of vocational learners.&#160; They may also be eligible to progress onto a full teaching role within an education and training provider organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The apprenticeship standard should be reviewed after a maximum of 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;",
