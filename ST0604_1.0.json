  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;The textile care industry encompasses commercial laundry and dry/wet cleaning. Commercial laundries provide laundry services and often product rental, to a wide range of sectors in the UK. This includes work-wear for manufacturing, industrial, food, transport and pharmaceutical sectors; and linen for hospitality, catering, hotel, hospital and care sectors. Dry/wet cleaning is defined as high street aftercare of garments and fabrics using solvents such as perchloroethylene or hydro-carbons (dry) or the relatively new aqueous-based process utilising detergents (wet).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are over 3,500 textile care businesses in the UK, ranging in size from SMEs to PLCs. The industry employs circa 32,000 employees and is worth in the region of &#163;1billion a year. Textile Care Services Operatives form the majority of employees in the sector and are at the heart of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Textile Care Services Operatives typical duties include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sorting and identifying incoming product, often using technology, e.g. work-wear, table cloths, sheets, towels, personal items for dry/wet cleaning;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensuring the product is high-quality and fit for purpose;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working safely and efficiently, whilst minimising the impact on the environment;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rectifying basic faults, e.g. product mis-feed;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Classifying products for appropriate cleaning process;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using appropriate chemicals to undertake the cleaning process, e.g. bleach;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operating specialist equipment/machinery to process products in line with standard operating procedures (SOPs), e.g. batch washing machines and presses steamers;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drying and finishing products whilst adhering to company quality procedures; and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Preparing and packing items for dispatch to meet customer requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Textile Care Services Operatives operate in an increasingly high technology based environment. Textile Care Service Operatives report to a Team Leader or Line Manager. They may also interact with Production Managers, General Managers, Engineers, Customer Service Executives, Account Managers, Drivers and customers.

Dry/wet cleaning is defined as high street aftercare of garments and fabrics using solvents such as perchloroethylene or hydro-carbons (dry) or the relatively new aqueous-based process utilising detergents (wet).\n\nThere are over 3,500 textile care businesses in the UK, ranging in size from SMEs to PLCs. The industry employs circa 32,000 employees and is worth in the region of &#163;1billion a year. Textile Care Services Operatives form the majority of employees in the sector and are at the heart of the operation. Textile Care Services Operatives operate in an increasingly high technology based environment. Textile Care Service Operatives report to a Team Leader or Line Manager. They may also interact with Production Managers, General Managers, Engineers, Customer Service Executives, Account Managers, Drivers and customers. Working patterns may include shift work, as much of the sector operates 365 days per year.\r\n",
