  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupation: Nuclear Operative&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Operative occupation has two distinct options. At the end of the apprenticeship you will be competent to be either a&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Decommissioning Operative &lt;/strong&gt;or &lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Process Operative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Occupational profile:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Core responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Operative &lt;/strong&gt;is responsible for the hands on operation of plant systems and equipment on a nuclear facility and associated off site plant. This will involve working within a variety of environments within nuclear facilities, either operational work or decommissioning work (a process of removing all radioactive, non-radioactive and contaminated plant and equipment), necessitating the use of innovative methods and equipment, where required, and the practical skills associated with this. The working conditions are varied and may involve wearing specialist safety equipment, and working on sites running 365 day operations. Nuclear Operatives will be required to work individually and as part of a team, meeting required standards and adhering to strict controls and procedures. Nuclear sites are highly regulated and a premium is placed on demonstrating an understanding of nuclear, radiological and conventional safety, together with the appropriate attitudes and behaviours to ensure apprentices comply with organisational safety and regulatory requirements at all times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Decommissioning option role responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Decommissioning Operative &lt;/strong&gt;is responsible for the safe operation and surveillance of nuclear plants within their decommissioning phase, including dismantling, removal and disposal of a variety of plant and equipment associated with a nuclear licensed site, often using state-of-the-art techniques and equipment. This will be achieved through disciplined operations, efficient team working, developing solutions to project requirements and the deployment of bespoke equipment to aid decommissioning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role will involve the sampling, size reduction, segregation and packaging of different categorisations of waste within a number of challenging environments, often in full personal and respiratory protective equipment, ensuring all work is conducted to national and industry standards and best practice to minimise any impact to the workforce, public and environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Process option role responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Process Operative &lt;/strong&gt;is responsible for safely carrying out plant process operations in a variety of nuclear operating plants including but not limited to fuel manufacture and storage, nuclear reactors, reprocessing, and waste processing and storage. The role requires a good understanding of the operating plant, processes and materials and the operating rules and procedures required for the safe operation of plant equipment, monitoring and adjusting controls, recording data in logs, taking operational samples and responding to emergency procedures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Core Skills:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Nuclear Operative &lt;/strong&gt;will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work safely in a nuclear environment under a Safe System of Work (SSOW) including Risk Assessment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply and comply with Operating Rules and Instructions and applying correct reporting procedures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monitor plant indications and conditions of plant and equipment closely and record data accordingly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify, respond and implement relevant actions in the event of abnormal or emergency situations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare work areas in radioactive and non-radioactive environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out Sampling Operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assemble and dismantle equipment and plant items&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out Waste management to sort, segregate, transfer &amp;amp; minimise waste arisings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operate effectively in Personal Protective Equipment, (PPE), such as respirators and pressurised suits&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conduct surveillance of plant equipment and processes to ensure correct operation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Respond correctly to equipment, facility and site alarms&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carryout the identified safe application of radiological monitoring equipment, process and assurance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Effectively communicate and handover tasks and work areas&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Configure, isolate and reinstate plant and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conduct plant and equipment decontamination activities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Interpret technical drawings and documentation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Safely operate plant process and systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operate ancillary equipment, e.g. cranes, fork lift trucks, access platforms, remote handling equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply routine problem solving techniques&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support and prepare alpha or beta/gamma radiation/contamination controlled work areas&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Effectively support and assist other work streams within their work environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carryout the safe delivery of identified minor maintenance activities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Additional skills for:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table style=&quot;height: 212px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 43px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 346px;
