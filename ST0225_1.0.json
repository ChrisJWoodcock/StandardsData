  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Horticulture or landscape operatives can be employed to work in public parks and gardens, green spaces and historic gardens, private gardens and estates or in production nurseries and retail outlets. Many businesses will be specialised in their activities, such as grounds maintenance (soft-landscape) or landscape construction (hard-landscape). Soft- landscaping includes the establishment and maintenance of plants and cultivated areas. Hard-landscaping includes establishment of hard surfaces and structures in addition to the establishment of plants in cultivated areas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The distinct nature of these two specialisms means very few businesses can offer the full breadth of skills and therefore two options are available for this occupation; horticulture and landscape construction. The employment area will dictate the option pursued. The horticulture option focuses on plant propagation and plant growth. The landscape construction option focuses on the installation of features and structures; application of landscape materials as well as supporting site management.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Work is generally based outside and undertaken throughout the year, so apprentices will frequently work outside in all weathers. Often people new to the industry will start in a ‘hands-on’ role covering a range of practical tasks, with specialist skills being learnt through progression. A wide range of machinery and tools are used and additional training may be required depending on the nature of the works undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Working and learning in the horticulture and landscape industries is rewarding, offers a diverse range of employment opportunities and includes a range of skills that are transferrable into many other industries.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Required skills, knowledge and behaviours to complete this apprenticeship&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Core knowledge - have an understanding of:&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Industry understanding; the importance and benefits of green-space and the types of horticultural skills appropriate to different businesses and cultural sites.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Business; business policies, vision and values.

Knowledge of hazards and working to strict health, safety, quality and environmental (HSQE) processes particularly appropriate to horticultural sites.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Environmental; waste and waste reduction and recycling and environmental best practice. Prevention and control of local pollution incidents.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Plant growth and development; plant nutrition and plant requirements. The principles of germination, photosynthesis, respiration and transpiration (the science of plant growth). How to care for plants correctly in different environments. The relationship between environmental conditions and plant growth.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Tools, equipment and machinery; correct tools, equipment and machinery required for the job and the importance of maintenance and regular checks of these items to ensure they remain in good working order. Legal requirement of training by a competent person and familiarity with operator training and certification requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Vegetation control; how to control vegetation and methods of site clearance and removal of vegetation&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Biosecurity; biosecurity and phytosanitary measures for pests and diseases and how these apply to work sites. Awareness of invasive alien species that may impact work methods.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Plant identification; plant identification by scientific names including genus, species and cultivar. Know why and how plants are identified.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Soil science; why, when and how to cultivate soils for differing purposes. Different growing media and mulches. How to modify soils for plant growth and understand the reasons for cultivation and drainage.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Plant health; basic pest and disease identification and symptoms and control methods.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Core skills - able to:&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Communication; communicate with others, including clients, the public and colleagues, this may require basic IT systems use.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Team working; work alone and as part of a team effectively and recognise how all staff are dependent on each other to meet business objectives.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Health and safety; apply relevant health and safety processes and procedures.

However it came to light that this was unclear and some apprentices have undertaken non Ofqual regulated Emergency First Aid at Work qualifications which comply with Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations 1998. In order that apprentices are not disadvantaged who hold these qualifications, the employers have agreed that they can enter end-point assessment (providing all other requirements have been met) up until Tuesday 30th June 2020. As from Wednesday 1st July 2020, all apprentices entering EPA, must have completed an Ofqual regulated, Level 3 Emergency First Aid at Work (EFAW) one day course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Apprenticeship level&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship standard is at level 2.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Review date&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3 years from Implementation&lt;/p&gt;",
