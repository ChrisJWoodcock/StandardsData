  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Social Work is an exciting and fulfilling international profession. As a Social Worker you will work in partnership with adults, children, carers and families in a range of different settings to support and promote positive change in people&#39;s lives in order to improve their wellbeing and independence, and to reduce risk and harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a social worker you will work within statutory and legislative frameworks, where you will use your professional judgement and build relationships with a variety of individuals and communities, as well as with a wide range of other professionals and agencies. In your role you will assess, plan, implement and evaluate complex situations. This requires an ability to critically reflect and make decisions within a clear professional code of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in social care services, health services and the voluntary and private sector.&#160;Social workers can work in children’s services or adult social care, and can specialise in areas such as mental health, learning difficulties, substance misuse or hospital work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers include local authorities, health organisations including the NHS, voluntary organisations, charities, and private businesses.&#160;&#160;Some social workers work independently, setting up their own companies to contract for work. Examples would include carrying out independent fostering assessment or providing practice education for student social workers and apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a registered Social Worker, you will engage in protecting individuals from harm, abuse, neglect and exploitation. You will work in a way which is compassionate and which takes account of all aspects of the individual’s life - ensuring their voice is central to decision making. You will use your professional expertise to work, assess, plan, implement, evaluate and intervene putting the needs of people first.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout your career, you will be responsible for ensuring your continuing professional development and will be expected to demonstrate leadership whatever your role. All Social Workers must register with the professional regulator and adhere to their professional standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with individuals, families, communities, and a wide range of other professionals and agencies including but not limited to education, health, housing, care service providers, police and probation.&#160;&#160; Within their own organisation they interact with the managers they report to and depending on the organisation Heads of Service, Occupational Therapists, support and administrative personnel, amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working with a number of people or families at any one time.&#160;&#160;Day-to-day work involves assessing people’s needs, strengths and wishes, working with individuals and families directly to help them make changes and resolve difficulties, organising support, making recommendations or referrals to other services and agencies, and keeping detailed records.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Social workers are usually supervised by a Team Manager and can be responsible for managing support staff&#160;and other staff, both qualified and unqualified, with less experience than themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Social Workers must register with the professional regulator and adhere to their professional standards.&#160;&#160;Social workers are responsible for making evidence-based judgements and making recommendations.&#160;&#160;They must do this within the relevant statutory and legislative frameworks, and practice guidance. Social workers receive regular supervision to support their professional development.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many Social Worker roles require a driving licence, but this does depend on the setting and geographic location.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Social Workers require a Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check.&lt;/p&gt;",
