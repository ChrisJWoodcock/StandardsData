  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Forestry is the art, science and practice of woodland establishment, maintenance and management, and timber harvesting. It is a diverse global industry with a wide range of career opportunities including planning and management, conservation, recreation, research and logistics. Sustainable forest management produces a vital natural resource while benefitting society and the environment, and workers across all disciplines of the industry share a passion for working in an industry with so much to contribute to global wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Forest Operative will carry out the practical operations required to create, maintain and harvest forests and woodlands. Some will carry out operations across the range from planting to harvesting whilst others will specialise in a particular part of the process. All will need to be able and willing to do challenging work outdoors and in all weathers, would be expected to be aware of the full range of forestry operations, and to understand the relationship between commercial, environmental and social forestry.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This Standard has two specialisms, candidates will need to choose one of:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;harvesting&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;establishment and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Knowledge (all core)&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Current forestry, environmental, health and safety and plant health legislation and codes of practice in relation to forestry work&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The principles of silviculture including a range of silvicultural systems and their application&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The identification of the forest and woodland tree species important in the UK&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The key threats, pests and diseases affecting UK trees and woodland&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The timber supply chain including the roles of the Landowner, Forest Works Manager, Contractor and Agent&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Basic mensuration&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Harvesting and extraction systems, and the factors affecting the cost of bringing timber to market&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The long-term effects of tree establishment, and the factors affecting the decision making process&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Skills&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Core Skills&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain good standards of practice in: health and safety;
