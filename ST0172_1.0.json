  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;Occupation: Farrier Level: 3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Farriers are responsible for the maintenance and care of Equine feet with a holistic approach to the equine, for which they must have a thorough understanding of all aspects of Equine hoof care throughout the equine disciplines, from grass roots pleasure equines right through to elite competition horses. Farriers are able to assess equines and their gait (movement). Farriers are responsible for the quality and accuracy of their work, must be good communicators and problem solvers, and able to discuss the condition of equines and their hooves with owners and other professionals, especially Veterinary Surgeons. Farriers are able to give advice on various equine welfare options, from a trim for a horse at pasture through to basic remedial work on lame equines. Farriery is a regulated profession and all farriers are required to pass the Diploma of the Worshipful Company of Farriers (DipWCF) examination before being admitted on to the Register of qualified Farriers before they may legally practise. Once qualified a farrier may either practise as an individual or join a farriery practice to work as part of a team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;caption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge, Skills and Behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is required- understanding of:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Health &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;The role of a farrier in monitoring and maintaining health and safety in the workplace.

To complete the apprenticeship apprentices will sit the Diploma of the Worshipful Company of Farriers (DipWCF) examination which is the prescribed examination for registration as set out under the Farriers (Registration) Act 1975. Upon successful award of the DipWCF qualification the apprentice will be entitled to use the post-nominal DipWCF and may apply for registration with FRC.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review:&lt;/strong&gt; The standard will be initially reviewed after three years.&lt;/p&gt;",
