  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;The following Standard reflects employers’ requirements for the skills, knowledge and behaviours required to be competent in the job role.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An Aircraft Maintenance Certifying Engineer works on maintaining and certifying aircraft of all types from small aeroplanes to airliners, jet fighters and helicopters, both civil and military. They should have a comprehensive knowledge of aircraft systems, carry out approved maintenance processes to maintain and certify the airworthiness of the aircraft. It involves highly skilled, complex and specialist work, maintaining aircraft systems according to approved data and work instructions, using relevant hand tools and equipment. They must comply with civil and or military regulatory and organisational requirements. They must be able to research data sources, ensuring that on completion of a task all aircraft documentation is accurately completed and certified. They must work both individually and as part of a larger team, including carrying out supervisory duties and oversight of work completed. They will demonstrate their ability to identify and resolve problems using the approved data, processes and understand the limits of their authority/approval. They will understand how and why Standard Operating Procedures are produced for maintaining aircraft and the importance of using them. &#160;An Aircraft Maintenance Licence will be required to carry out this role.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical Job titles: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Aircraft Maintenance, Aircraft Maintenance Engineer, Aircraft Certifying Engineer, Aircraft Engineer and Fixed and Rotary Wing&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;l&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e Requirements (Knowledge and Skills)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There are different civil and or military requirements which need a range of options depending upon the employer context.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Use of mathematical techniques, algebraic expressions, formulae, calculation and physics to understand the theory of flight, aerodynamics and aviation maintenance processes&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Understand the structure, properties and characteristics of materials used in the construction, maintenance and repair of aircraft components, whole structures and sub-assemblies&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Understand the fundamentals of electrical, electronic, digital, analogue, aircraft systems and maintenance practices&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Read, interpret, explain and suggest improvements to engineering data; drawings, specifications, maintenance manuals, computer generated information and aircraft documentation&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Safe selection and use of hand and mechanical tools and equipment while carrying out maintenance of aircraft&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Appropriate bonding and assembly techniques e.g. in composite assembly&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Complying with and ensuring others comply with statutory military and/ or civil air legislation, quality and organisational requirements for aviation safety and occupational health and safety while carrying out aircraft maintenance techniques&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Human Factors in aviation – developing an understanding of attitudes and behaviours to ensure aviation safety&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Use, analyse and interpret the results obtained from test equipment, both mechanical and electronic while carrying out aircraft maintenance activities&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Undertake and supervise aircraft functional checks and fault diagnosis e.g. electrical bonding and earthing; flight control rigging and adjustment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Correct selection, use and training of ground support equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Inspect, repair, remove and replace aircraft major assemblies, components, sub-assemblies and systems.

All routes have core knowledge requirements b ut practical skills options are likely to differ but are of comparable weighting. Full details of the requirements including core and options, minimum requirements and rules of combination are contained in the &lt;strong&gt;Employer Occupational Brief (EOB) within the Assessment Strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Employer Selected Options:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Maintenance and rectification of aircraft avionic systems&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Maintenance and rectification of power-plant (piston &amp;amp; turbine engines), propellers &amp;amp; rotors&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Helicopter systems maintenance and practices&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Fixed wing systems maintenance and practices&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Application of business improvement techniques (personal accountability requirements) for working in an airworthiness environment (Maintenance practices)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Assembly, repair and replacement of pipe work for aircraft and engine systems&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Inspect, repair, remove and replace aircraft electrical system wiring and components&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Select and use appropriate electrical and avionic test equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Supervision of aircraft flight-line handling operations and/or second line maintenance activities&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Requirements: Employee Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Modern maintenance organisations require their employees to have a set of behaviours that will ensure success both in their role and in the overall company objectives.

Each qualification has a core and options approach and employers will select the most applicable pathway and unit options to meet their business requirements. Further detail can be found in the Employer Occupational Brief which is an annex to the Assessment Plan.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There will be an assessment at the end of the development phase where the apprentice will need to demonstrate full competence against the qualification outcomes for knowledge, skills and behaviours, set out in the Standard and Employer Occupational Brief. On successful completion of the employer endorsement phase (sign off) apprentices will be then be put forward to be awarded their Apprenticeship completion certificate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Knowledge and vocational qualifications that meet national and/or regulatory requirements will be included on the Certificate.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship will be recognised by relevant Professional Engineering Institutions at the appropriate level of professional registration (EngTech). The apprentice will also have made a successful application for an EASA Part 66 category B Licence&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level and Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This Apprenticeship Standard is at Level 4 (equivalent to Higher National Diploma) and will be reviewed after three years to ensure it continues to meet employers’ requirements and provides the basis for progression to higher qualifications and or jo b roles.&lt;/p&gt;",
