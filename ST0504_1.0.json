  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Floorlayer is a trained craftsperson who will be involved with the installation of either carpets, vinyl, linoleum and rubber or laminate and wood flooring and will work for large and small employers in all types of buildings within a diverse range of commercial and domestic environments. Buildings may be existing or new and part of a construction site, such as housing estates, schools, shops, hospitals, airports or more iconic buildings such as the Shard or the Olympic Stadium in London.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Floorlayer works in an efficient and safe manner, and ensure high levels of customer care, particularly within the domestic environment; working alone or within a team. The type of floorcovering will vary from basic to designer installations, thus working with a diverse range of materials and designs, and being one of the finishing trades, will significantly contribute to the ‘look and feel’ of a building and can provide great personal satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The main duties and tasks include preparing the work area and sub-floor to a suitable standard to enable the following installation of floorcoverings to the clients specification.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Floorlayers need to be good at communicating, able to interact effectively with colleagues, clients and associated trades e.g. plumbers, electricians, painters. They must also be able to interpret drawings and extract relevant information to complete the installation of the flooring, but be flexible, in adapting their approach and techniques when faced with unexpected site conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship consists of a core and options and apprentices are required to select one option depending upon their job role. The occupations covered by this standard are:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Textile &amp;amp; Resilient Floorlayer – prepares subfloors and installs textile floorcoverings (g. carpet from a roll and carpet tiles) and also resilient floorcoverings (e.g. vinyl, linoleum and rubber, in sheet and tile formats)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Wood Floorlayer – prepares subfloors and installs laminate and wood flooring in various formats.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Completion of the apprenticeship will allow individuals to meet the requirements (Skilled Worker) of construction industry registration schemes (Construction Skills Certification Scheme – CSCS).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Floorlayers need to understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;current legislation and the principles of health, safety, welfare and environmentally responsible work practices and how they must be applied in relation to their work, self and to others&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;employment rights and responsibilities, keeping floorlaying skills and knowledge up to date, career progression, industry card registration&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;organisational policies, procedures and documentation and their relevance and importance for installing floorcovering&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;when, why and what personal protective equipment should be used and how to use it correctly whilst floorlaying&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;principles of construction, utility supplies, and their impact on installing floorcovering&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;how and when flooring installations need to be adapted to accommodate the needs of disabled people or people with learning disabilities&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;how flooring installations may be affected in older (pre-1919) buildings, but particularly in listed buildings of any age.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;how floorlaying materials and techniques may differ in different industry sectors eg residential, commercial, refurbishment, new build&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;interpreting different types of information, including Building Information Modelling (BIM), drawings (digital and hard copy), method statements, risk assessments, manufacturers’ information, work schedules, specifications and relevant standards and their relevance in ensuring appropriate, safe and quality flooring installations&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;safe handling and moving of waste materials, flooring installation materials and equipment, manually and with mechanical aids or lifting equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;why and how resources should be stored in a safe and secure manner e.g. different materials, tools and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;assessing and testing existing floor surface conditions and evaluating results to ensure a successful installation eg: temperature (including presence of underfloor heating), moisture, level, surface and sub-floor condition&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;planning methods appropriate for flooring installation including phasing work and acclimatisation of materials before laying; taking into account the type of contract and other works being undertaken.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;methods to estimate floorlaying materials and resources required based on the type of contract, manufacturers information and site conditions&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the characteristics and correct uses of preparation methods for different sub-floor surfaces, ready for the installation of floorcoverings including; the mixing and application of repair and smoothing compounds, mixing and application of damp proof membranes, the installation of plywood underlays and sheet membranes&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;methods and techniques used in measuring, marking and setting out for installing floorcoverings to horizontal, inclined, stepped and shaped/coved surfaces; patterned and non-patterned materials&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;how testing and preparation of sub-floor tools and equipment should be safely used and maintained&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;how to finish the laid floorcovering, including thresholds, skirtings, coverstrips, stair nosings, trims and temporary protection of installed flooring&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;how to work efficiently and minimise problems during flooring installation&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;how to dispose of or recycle floorlaying waste materials appropriately&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Skills - Floorlayers will be able to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;work safely and securely in compliance with given information, organisational policies and procedures, and current health, safety, environmental and welfare legislation&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;select and use appropriate personal protective equipment for the floorlaying task&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;plan the work to be carried out in accordance with the job specification, including; assessing the sub floor and work area, measuring, producing scale drawings, setting out, calculating material quantities and determining the resources needed (including the tools and equipment)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;work efficiently and complete the floorlaying work in accordance with the agreed specification and timescales&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;prepare the work area including securing the site, the removal and appropriate disposal of existing floorcovering&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;assess and evaluate physical and environmental conditions to ensure successful installation eg temperature, humidity, condition of the site&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;prepare the sub floor for the floorcovering, including; removal of contaminants by manual, mechanical and chemical means, disposal of waste materials, mixing and application of repair and smoothing compounds, mixing and application of damp proof membranes, the installation of plywood, underlays and sheet membranes&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;carry out remedial works in line with the specification&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li style=&quot;list-style-type: none;&quot;&gt;dispose of and recycle waste materials appropriately&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1 Knowledge – Textile and Resilient Floorlayers need to understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the different types of carpet floorcovering, including: woven, non-woven;
